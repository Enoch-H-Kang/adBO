    "reference_response": "It seems like you're trying to create an asynchronous program for recording and transcribing audio, which also responds to media key presses. This Python program aims to perform these operations possibly on a Raspberry Pi or similar device, given the mention of `rs232` which is often associated with serial communication common in embedded systems. Looking at the code you have posted, here are a few observations and suggestions: 1. **TypeError in `extract_weight` Function**: The error message you received indicates a problem with the `extract_weight` function: ``` TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object ``` This suggests that `audio_text` was not a string when it was passed into `re.findall()`. You might want to verify that `transcriber.transcribe_audio()` actually returns a string, and that `await audio_text` correctly awaits the result of the transcription. 2. **Ensure Async Context for File Operations**: When dealing with `asyncio`, make sure that all file operations are also done in an asynchronous context. Instead of `audio_file = open(\"audio.mp3\", \"rb\")`, considering the async nature of your program, you'd likely need to use an asynchronous library to open the file, such as `aiofiles`. 3. **Global Variables**: You are using a number of global variables, e.g., `adress`, `stop_recording`, `transcriber`, and `check_weight`. Be cautious with this practice as it can make debugging and tracking state across your program harder. 4. **Media Key Event Handling**: It looks like you're attempting to use media keys to control the recording. However, the `on_press` function will only work as expected if your script is running a listener loop for keyboard events. This usually comes from a library like `pynput`, but I don't see it being executed here. 5. **POST Request to FastAPI Endpoint**: When you're creating an HTTP POST request to your FastAPI endpoint, ensure that the FastAPI server is running and the endpoint matches the one configured in your FastAPI app. 6. **FastAPI Asynchronous Task Creation**: You’re correctly using `asyncio.create_task()` to start the recording asynchronously. Just make sure your FastAPI instance is running under an ASGI server that supports asynchronous tasks, like Uvicorn or Hypercorn. 7. **Async Handling of `transcribe_audio`**: Make sure you await the call to `transcriber.transcribe_audio()` and correctly handle its result before proceeding. This is particularly important because you need the transcription result for further processing. 8. **Improper Use of `await`**: This line seems incorrect: ```python await audio_text ``` If `transcribe_audio()` is an async coroutine and returns an awaitable, you should capture the result with something like: ```python audio_text = await transcriber.transcribe_audio(\"audio.wav\") ``` 9. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling around your network requests and other operations that might fail to ensure robustness, and handle potential exceptions gracefully. Remember that when working with asynchronous code in Python, you must ensure all parts of the async chain are consistent to avoid blocking operations which can freeze the cooperative multitasking provided by `asyncio`. Before deploying this code, a thorough review and testing cycle is needed to handle the edge cases and potential race conditions inherent in asynchronous operations, especially since you are interacting with external services and hardware events.",

    "reference_response": "The following scholars have provided insights into the textual variations between the Dead Sea Scrolls and the Masoretic Text of the Hebrew Bible: Donald W. Parry highlights the existence of variant readings in biblical texts as demonstrated by comparisons made with the Dead Sea Scrolls. He recognizes these findings in his contribution to \"The Oxford Handbook of the Dead Sea Scrolls,\" edited by Timothy H. Lim and John J. Collins (Oxford University Press, 2008, pp. 223-244). Peter W. Flint asserts that the Dead Sea Scrolls reveal textual discrepancies in the Hebrew Bible that were present during the Second Temple period, illustrating deviations in both wording and content. His analysis can be found in \"The Dead Sea Scrolls and the Bible\" (Eerdmans Publishing, 2013). Lawrence H. Schiffman discusses how biblical manuscripts from the Dead Sea Scrolls can differ from the traditional Masoretic Text, indicating that inconsistencies, copyist's errors, and textual variations already existed in the Second Temple era. Schiffman's views are detailed in \"Reclaiming the Dead Sea Scrolls\" (Jewish Publication Society, 2010). Craig A. Evans comments on the fluidity of the biblical texts during the Second Temple period, with variations and discrepancies in the Dead Sea Scrolls signaling an openness to changes during that time. More information on his perspective can be found in his book, \"From Prophecy to Testament: The Function of the Old Testament in the New\" (Bloomsbury Publishing, 2012). Frank Moore Cross provides perspective on the value of the Dead Sea Scrolls for understanding textual variations in the Hebrew Bible, indicating the influence of scribal practices and alterations over time. Cross elaborates on these themes in the article, \"The Text Behind the Texts: Textual Criticism and the Dead Sea Scrolls,\" included in the third edition of \"Harper's Bible Dictionary\" (1996). Charlotte Hempel explores the differences reflected in the Qumran biblical scrolls compared to other well-known texts, suggesting that the biblical text has been subject to evolution and variation through antiquity. Her research is compiled in \"The Laws of the Damascus Document: Sources, Tradition and Redaction\" (Brill, 1998).",

Функция `EmbedDataInBMP` принимает три аргумента: `bmpFile_` - путь к исходному BMP-изображению, `dataFile_` - путь к текстовому файлу с данными для встраивания, и `outputFile_` - путь к выходному файлу, который будет содержать встроенные данные. 2. `imageData` считывает бинарные данные BMP-изображения. 3. `dataToEmbed` импортирует данные из файла, который нужно встроить (`dataFile_`), с использованием кодировки “WindowsCyrillic” и преобразует их в список чисел, соответствующих кодам символов текста. 4. Проверка на наличие данных для встраивания: если `dataToEmbed` пуст, выводится сообщение о том, что нет данных для встраивания, и функция возвращает значение `False`. 5. `dataSizeBytes` представляет размер данных для встраивания в виде списка из 4 байтов, который будет в использован для записи размера вставляемых данных в изображение. 6. `extendedData` дополняет данные до кратного 16 путем добавления нулевых байтов, если это необходимо. 7. `modifiedImageData` объединяет исходные бинарные данные изображения (исключая первые 54 байта, которые обычно представляют заголовок BMP-файла), добавляет размер данных и непосредственно встраиваемые данные. Остаток изображения (начиная со следующего байта после вставленных данных) копируется без изменений. 8. С помощью функции `OpenWrite` создается поток для записи в выходной файл в бинарном режиме. С помощью `BinaryWrite` модифицированные данные записываются в этот файл, а затем поток закрывается функцией `Close`. 9. Проверяется успешность создания выходного файла. Если файл создан, выводится сообщение о том, что встраивание данных выполнено успешно, и функция возвращает значение `True`. В противном случае выводится сообщение об ошибке, и функция возвращает `False`. 10. Затем, этот кусок кода создает пути к файлам BMP-изображения и к текстовому файлу с данными для встраивания и вызывает функцию `EmbedDataInBMP`, чтобы выполнить процесс встраивания. 11. После встраивания (если оно было успешным), код должен был бы извлекать данные из BMP-изображения с помощью `ExtractDataFromBMP`, однако определение этой функции отсутствует в предоставленном фрагменте кода. Если функция `ExtractDataFromBMP` работает корректно и извлекает данные, путь к извлеченным данным должен выводиться в диалоговое окно с сообщением о том, где сохранены данные. Обратите внимание, что последний блок кода не будет работать, так как функция `ExtractDataFromBMP` не определена в предоставленном вами фрагменте. Кроме того, пути к файлам содержат символы кириллицы, что требует специального внимания при работе с файловой системой и кодировками в операционных системах, особенно если код исполняется на машинах с не кириллической локалью.",

In the examples of 11 and 12, the operator firstly emphasizes his institutional identity through claiming to be a “police officer”. Then through strict wording, he attempts to dis￾tance from the recipient with the use of legal lexical resources like “strictly combat”, “accept the case to investigate”, “cancel the lawsuit” and “explain clearly”. Such a question like “Are you clear?” does not require the recipient to answer, but is adopted to confirm the differences of the identity and status of the operator and the recipient, positioning the recipient in the identity of the “suspected offender” who should make a truthful confes￾sion. The party with greater power in the conversation is usually the initiator of the turn, who can control the content and interrupt the other party. People in communication achieve their specific communicative purpose by choosing discourse resources and give meaning to the linguistic symbol according to the purpose in the process of communication. The purpose is closely linked to institutional power, and the realization of purpose is closely related to power as well. The operator constructs his “police” identity through discoursal practice and obtains the power entitled by the law, thereby achieving the purposes of obtaining information and defrauding money (see examples 13 and 14). Generic structure of the telecom and internet fraud Genres are ways in which people “get things done” through their use of language in par￾ticular contexts or discourse communities. Bhatia (1993, 13) describes genre as a recogniz￾able communicative event characterized by a set of communicative purpose(s) identified and mutually understood by the members of the professional or academic community in which it regularly occurs. It is primarily characterized by the communicative purpose(s) that it is intended to fulfill. As a type of genre, the discourse of the telecom and internet fraud has fixed “phone script” with relatively stable moves, with linguistic structure and stylistic features of “professional” discourses, representing the communicative purpose and ideology shared by all the members of the “professional” discourse community. The genre is implemented by actors of different identities at respective stages, and the generic structure presents multiple characteristics (See Table 1). Moves are presented in left column and discourse resources of each move and step are on the right. The telecom and internet fraud genre provides a “template” for the members of the dis\u0002course community, i.e. the fraudsters, to conduct illegal activities.

You should transfer all the funds to the [REDACTED] card and follow our instructions to do a certification online. In the examples of 11 and 12, the operator firstly emphasizes his institutional identity through claiming to be a “police officer”. Then through strict wording, he attempts to dis￾tance from the recipient with the use of legal lexical resources like “strictly combat”, “accept the case to investigate”, “cancel the lawsuit” and “explain clearly”. Such a question like “Are you clear?” does not require the recipient to answer, but is adopted to confirm the differences of the identity and status of the operator and the recipient, positioning the recipient in the identity of the “suspected offender” who should make a truthful confes￾sion. The party with greater power in the conversation is usually the initiator of the turn, who can control the content and interrupt the other party. People in communication achieve their specific communicative purpose by choosing discourse resources and give meaning to the linguistic symbol according to the purpose in the process of communication. The purpose is closely linked to institutional power, and the realization of purpose is closely related to power as well. The operator constructs his “police” identity through discoursal practice and obtains the power entitled by the law, thereby achieving the purposes of obtaining information and defrauding money (see examples 13 and 14). Generic structure of the telecom and internet fraud Genres are ways in which people “get things done” through their use of language in particular contexts or discourse communities. Bhatia (1993, 13) describes genre as a recognizable communicative event characterized by a set of communicative purpose(s) identified and mutually understood by the members of the professional or academic community in which it regularly occurs. It is primarily characterized by the communicative purpose(s) that it is intended to fulfill. As a type of genre, the discourse of the telecom and internet fraud has fixed “phone script” with relatively stable moves, with linguistic structure and stylistic features of “professional” discourses, representing the communicative purpose and ideology shared by all the members of the “professional” discourse community. The genre is implemented by actors of different identities at respective stages, and the generic structure presents multiple characteristics (See Table 1). Moves are presented in left column and discourse resources of each move and step are on the right. The telecom and internet fraud genre provides a “template” for the members of the dis\u0002course community, i.e. the fraudsters, to conduct illegal activities. They use the template to plan, adjust, and implement behaviors for their intended target.

    "reference_response": "Bram Stoker, the renowned Irish author, sat in his study, surrounded by his own literary creations. The year was 1908, and Stoker was famous for his chilling tale, \"Dracula.\" It was during this time that Stoker's attention was drawn to a peculiar series of novels. Rumors spread of a mysterious author who had combined his own original ideas with characters and worlds from other famous authors' works. Intrigued, Stoker obtained a copy of one of these novels and delved into its pages. His eyes widened as he discovered a morally ambiguous protagonist, embarking on incredible adventures that intertwine with characters from well-known stories. The first story he read took him back in time, where the protagonist traveled alongside Ebenezer Scrooge from Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol.\" Stoker found himself captivated by the seamless blend of originality and familiarity. The unknown author had managed to skillfully merge his own creations with the beloved characters from classic literature. Curiosity fueling him, Stoker continued reading another story in the series. This time, the protagonist found himself in the dark alleys of London, teaming up with the legendary detective Sherlock Holmes, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Stoker marveled at the audacity of the unknown author, intertwining the world of his own Count Dracula with the brilliant mind of Holmes. It was a daring endeavor, but one that appeared to work flawlessly on the pages. Eager to explore more, Stoker discovered that the novels also transported the protagonist to exotic locations, often encountering famous literary figures or iconic inventions. In one adventure, the protagonist traveled through time, utilizing H.G. Wells' time machine, in a journey that took them across centuries. In another, the hero was embroiled in the affairs of Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice,\" where even Sherlock Holmes made an unexpected appearance. As Stoker engrossed himself in these novels, he realized the brilliance behind their creation. The unknown author had a keen understanding of the characters and worlds he borrowed from, weaving them seamlessly into his original plotlines. The morals and motives of the protagonist remained ambiguous, further intensifying the intrigue within the stories. Deeply impressed, Stoker contemplated the impact these novels could have on literature. The mix of originality and familiarity had the potential to captivate readers in unimaginable ways. Inspired by this unknown author's audacity, Stoker toyed with his own ideas of incorporating beloved characters into future novels. Enthralled, Stoker attempted to learn the identity of this enigmatic and innovative author. As he delved deeper, he discovered that the novels were published under the pseudonym \"Anonymous Curator.\" No one knew who this author was, further adding to the mystique surrounding the series. Driven by a desire to meet the mastermind behind these remarkable novels, Stoker embarked on a journey of his own. He traveled to London and immersed himself in the literary circles, seeking any clues to unravel the identity of \"Anonymous Curator.\" Months turned into a year, and Stoker's pursuit became an obsession. He interacted with countless authors, publishers, and literary enthusiasts, hoping to find a lead. But alas, the true identity of the elusive author remained undiscovered. Regardless of his unsuccessful quest, Stoker remained forever changed by the novels of \"Anonymous Curator.\" Their influence would forever shape his own writing, inspiring him to push the boundaries of imagination and storytelling. In the years that followed, Stoker continued to produce his own masterpieces, thrilling readers with his evocative tales of horror and suspense. However, he never forgot the novels that opened his mind to the possibilities of blending worlds and characters. Decades later, as the literary world celebrated Stoker's legacy, some speculated that he himself was the mysterious \"Anonymous Curator.\" Although there was no concrete evidence to support this claim, it remained a tantalizing mystery, forever tied to the tale of Bram Stoker and the novels that blurred the lines between reality and fiction.",

Επίσης, ήταν υποψήφιος στις εκλογές του 2019 για τη θέση του Δημάρχου της Αθήνας, ωστόσο δεν κατάφερε να εκλεγεί. Το 2021, διορίστηκε στη θέση του υπουργού Υποδομών και Μεταφορών στην κυβέρνηση Μητσοτάκη. Ωστόσο, στις 26 Ιουλίου της ίδιας χρονιάς υπέβαλε την παραίτησή του λόγω της αυξανόμενης πίεσης που ασκήθηκε στο πρόσωπό του για την απόφασή του να αναστείλει την αλλαγή του προσωπικού της εταιρείας Athens International Airport, λόγω του δεσμού της συμβολής της με την κρατική εταιρεία ΕΛΕΝΑΟΛ.",

    "user_query": "To follow up on your self-assessment, we invite you to use the SMARTS formula presented below in order to transform a few of your checked statements into specific objectives. This exercise will help guide your next steps in further developing your competencies. According to the SMARTS formula, your objectives must be Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Rewarding, Time sensitive and Shared. Specific: Objectives need to be precise. Often objectives are too vague. An example of a vague objective is “I’ll work hard.” However, they should be formulated with precise details. For example, “I will document all my work and share my progress in weekly team meetings.” Measurable: Objectives need to be quantifiable. Measurable objectives give concrete information. For example, “I will produce three interim reports and one final report.” Including quantitative information makes it possible to determine whether the objective has been met. Achievable: Objectives need to be reasonable and achievable. Initially, many students believe they can achieve more than what is reasonable given the available time, resources and so on. Frequently, success or failure depends on setting achievable goals. An example of an unachievable objective is “I will revamp the entire SAP system by the end of the project.” Rewarding: Objectives need to matter in order to make you push yourself. It is important to stretch ourselves, try new things and feel rewarded by our achievements. Time sensitive: Objectives need to have a deadline. A due date gives a sense of urgency—the driving force to take action—and therefore increases the likelihood that the objective will be met. It also makes it possible to monitor progress. Shared: Objectives need to be shared with others. Objectives of a project are effective when shared. You will share these with your supervisor. You will also meet with your supervisor to discuss them and get them approved. Example of transforming a behavioural sentence from the list above into a SMARTS objective Examples:  Select and appropriately use the digital tools and resources that promote my learning and take advantage of online learning opportunities (webinars, Twitter threads, etc.).  Adopt, learn, and develop new technology practices so that I can adapt to different professional environments. Transformation of sentences using SMARTS format. 1. By April 13, I will have completed five drafts of a major presentation on clinical trial data, as well as having done some classification of the data. This will increase my proficiency with data processing in Microsoft Office, as well as give me insight into Canadian clinical trials. 2. I will study various relevant newspaper articles to find the discourse of advocates, organizations and governments (federal and provincial) on immigration in Ontario. This discourse analysis will allow me to improve my research skills using the Eureka database. Perfection not required: The objectives pursued are rarely perfect. But if you design them with care, an open mind, and a willingness to change, you’ll be more effective and productive. In fact, with a little planning upfront, you may well exceed your employer’s expectations! Elements to consider: 1. Your goals may change and evolve over the course of your experiences and should be revised regularly. 2. If you do not achieve 100% of your objectives at the end of your experience, simply explain the reasons in your reflections. 3. Use the SMARTS formula to assess the accuracy of your objectives as well as the actions you took to achieve them, the results, and the outcomes. 4. Use a journal to keep track of your thoughts and experiences, as these valuable notes could be used to evaluate your goals or as anecdotal examples in your reflective evaluation.",

I will dedicate at least 1 hour each week to explore and utilize new digital tools that enhance my learning experience. I will document the tools used and the insights gained, and share these with my mentor during our monthly meeting to discuss potential applications within my current projects. 2. **Adopt, learn, and develop new technology practices so that I can adapt to different professional environments.** **SMARTS Objective:** By May 15th, I will have learned to use two new technology tools, such as a project management software and a new programming language relevant to my field, and will complete two small projects using these tools. This will be showcased through a presentation to my supervisor and team, demonstrating my proficiency and adaptability to different technological environments. Feedback from the presentation will help identify areas for continued growth. Remember to periodically review and adjust your objectives as necessary. Documenting your process in a journal will also be beneficial for capturing experiences and reflecting on your goals. Keep in mind that the process itself can be as valuable as the outcome, and continuous improvement is an important aspect of professional development.",

Between 2017 and 2019, reports suggest that property prices in Lisbon increased at an average annual rate of approximately 10% to 20%. However, it is important to note that these figures can vary depending on various factors such as the specific location within central Lisbon, market conditions, the condition of the property, and other individual factors.

    "reference_response": "The error you encountered, 'STF', might indicate a specific issue with the smart contract or the transaction parameters. In order to troubleshoot this error, consider the following steps: 1. Verify that the token addresses are correct, and that they are compatible with the Uniswap V3 SwapRouter contract. 2. Double-check the values for the swap parameters, such as `fee`, `amountIn`, `amountOutMinimum`, and `sqrtPriceLimitX96`, to ensure they are within the valid ranges allowed by the contract. 3. Ensure you have the required amount of tokens to make the swap. 4. Make sure your private key is correct, and the address associated with your private key has enough Ether to pay for the gas fees. 5. Verify that you're providing sufficient gas to the transaction, as gas estimation can sometimes fail, and your transaction might need more gas than you're providing. You can try increasing the value of the `gasLimit` parameter when sending transactions. 6. Research the specific smart contract you are interacting with and look for any additional documentation or resources to understand the 'STF' error message. This could be an issue within the contract itself, and you might need to revise how you call the functions. Remember that debugging and troubleshooting issues in code can be a process of trial and error. Keep trying different approaches and make sure to understand the smart contracts and parameters you are working with.",

    "reference_response": "The stack trace you've provided indicates that your Android application (`com.Zadalhorof.AbjadWorld`) has encountered a fatal error and crashed with an `abort` signal (SIGABRT). This type of error typically occurs when there is a severe issue that the operating system or runtime cannot recover from, such as an assertion failure or an unhandled exception in native code. Here's a breakdown of the key components of the stack trace: 1. The application was built with Unity (version `2020.3.21f1`) using the `il2cpp` scripting backend. 2. The crash occurred on an ARM64 architecture device (or probably an emulator given the `sdk_gphone64_arm64/emu64a` in the Build fingerprint). 3. The error happened on the `RenderThread`, which suggests it's related to graphics or rendering. 4. The `signal 6 (SIGABRT)` indicates that the process was terminated by the `abort` function, commonly used to terminate the application due to a serious error. 5. The backtrace provides more specific information on where the error occurred within the system libraries, mainly within the graphics-related libraries (`libgui.so`, `libEGL.so`, and `libhwui.so`). These are Android system libraries in charge of graphics rendering and display. Based on the specific functions listed in the backtrace, e.g., `SurfaceComposerClient::Transaction::merge`, `BLASTBufferQueue::acquireNextBufferLocked`, `Surface::queueBuffer`, and `eglSwapBuffers`, the error appears to relate to buffer management or rendering on the surface. The cause for this error could be various reasons such as: - A bug in the rendering code of your application. - An issue with OpenGL ES or EGL calls, possibly resulting in the mishandling of resources or improper synchronization. - An error in the graphics driver or emulator code. - A corruption of memory or improper handling of reference counts in native code, potentially indicated by `android::RefBase::decStrong`. To further investigate and solve this issue, consider the following steps: 1. Since it's a native crash, if you have native code in your application, review related parts, especially any recent changes that could have introduced the bug. 2. Check if the error is reproducible on different devices or if it's specific to certain devices or emulators. If it's specific, it might be a hardware or OS version related issue. 3. Look up any related Unity engine issues, as the Unity version you're using might have known issues or bugs that have been fixed in later releases. 4. If your application is handling OpenGL ES or EGL resources directly, verify that all resources are correctly managed and released. 5. Review the specific functions mentioned in the stack trace for any known issues or patterns that could lead to an abort situation. 6. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Unity support with the provided crash logs or discussing it within the Unity developer community for additional insights. 7. Update libraries and the Unity engine to the latest stable versions, which may contain bug fixes. 8. Utilize debugging tools to capture more detailed logs around the crash point. Keep in mind that debugging native crashes can be challenging, and it often requires a solid understanding of the system's inner workings and the application's native code.",

    "reference_response": "To optimize the JavaScript code, you can follow several strategies such as caching DOM references, reducing repetitive DOM queries, and organizing your code for better readability and performance. Here's a revised version of the script with optimization techniques applied: Firstly, cache the DOM elements that you access multiple times to prevent querying the DOM repetitively: ```javascript const departureInput = document.getElementById(\"departure\"); const destinationInput = document.getElementById(\"destination\"); const scheduleContainer = document.getElementById(\"scheduleContainer\"); async function submitForm() { const departure = departureInput.value; const destination = destinationInput.value; const time = \"12:24\"; // If time isn't supposed to be hard-coded, you should fetch it from the user input. const apiUrl = `https://busapi.amithv.xyz/api/v1/schedules?departure=${encodeURIComponent( departure )}&destination=${encodeURIComponent(destination)}`; try { const response = await fetch(apiUrl); const scheduleData = await response.json(); updateSchedule(scheduleData); } catch (error) { console.error(\"Error fetching data:\", error); } } function updateSchedule(scheduleData) { const departureUpper = departureInput.value.toUpperCase(); const destinationUpper = destinationInput.value.toUpperCase(); scheduleContainer.innerHTML = \"\"; scheduleData.forEach(trip => { const vehicleDiv = createVehicleDiv(trip.vehicle_number, trip.trip); scheduleContainer.appendChild(vehicleDiv); let hasDeparted = false; let hasArrived = false; trip.stations.forEach((station, stationIndex, stations) => { const stationDiv = createStationDiv(station, stationIndex, stations, departureUpper, destinationUpper, hasDeparted, hasArrived); if (station.station.toUpperCase() === departureUpper) { hasDeparted = true; } if (station.station.toUpperCase() === destinationUpper) { hasArrived = true; } scheduleContainer.appendChild(stationDiv); }); }); } function createVehicleDiv(vehicleNumber, trip) { const vehicleDiv = document.createElement(\"div\"); vehicleDiv.textContent = `Vehicle Number: ${vehicleNumber}, Trip: ${trip}`; return vehicleDiv; } function createStationDiv(station, stationIndex, stations, departureUpper, destinationUpper, hasDeparted, hasArrived) { // Your existing logic to create the station div // ... return stationDiv; } ``` In this optimized script, we've made the following changes: 1. Caching DOM references: The `departureInput`, `destinationInput`, and `scheduleContainer` elements are accessed more than once, so we store their references in variables and reuse them, which is more efficient than querying the DOM every time. 2. Functions to create elements: We've split the logic for creating DOM elements into separate functions such as `createVehicleDiv` and `createStationDiv`. This modular approach makes the code cleaner, easier to read, and maintain. 3. Code separation: By moving out the code for creating DOM elements into its own function, the `updateSchedule` function now focuses on iterating over the schedule data and managing the state (`hasDeparted` and `hasArrived` flags). Remember to fill out the `createStationDiv` function with the logic necessary to create and return the `stationDiv` elements and implement any conditions for coloring and appending other child elements. Also, reconsider the hard-coded time (\"12:24\"). If it's supposed to be user input, you should get the value from the user's input field. Please note that the level of optimization often depends on the specific use case, scale, and performance requirements. The above suggestions cover general best practices and should be adjusted based on the actual application context.",

I promise I won't take advantage of you too much. But I must say, this hypnotizing business sounds fascinating. Maybe Yasmin could show me a thing or two sometime. Dave: (laughs) It's certainly an experience, Morag. Speaking of which, is there anything else you need me to do? Morag: Actually, let's take a break for now.

It would be nice to relax for a bit. (Scene: Morag's living room. Dave and Morag are sitting comfortably, enjoying their takeout while a movie plays on the TV.)

    "reference_response": "The passage you've provided does employ a lot of descriptive language and several powerful figurative elements to convey the atmosphere of a hospital and the emotions of the main character, Max. Whether it is \"overwrought\" can be a subjective assessment, depending on the context within the larger narrative and the intended effect on the reader. Overwrought writing is often characterized by being excessively complex, overly dramatic, or laden with too many embellishments, which can detract from the clarity or believability of the prose. In this case, there are places where the prose feels quite dense with metaphors and descriptive details (\"My bean is now a little cucumber\"), but it also gives a vivid impression of Max's relief and joy at his daughter's recovery and the impending return home. The intent seems to be to create an intense emotional experience, reflecting both the chaotic environment of the hospital and the personal drama of Max's situation. Whether it succeeds or is overwrought may depend on the reader's preference for descriptive writing as well as the pacing and tone of the surrounding text in the actual narrative. If the aim is to portray the intensity of Max's feelings without overwhelming the reader, the passage might benefit from a slight simplification, focusing on the most essential and impactful details.

But although the book has something in common with the pure gothic fiction of the 18th and 19th centuries, it is really only a distant cousin of the genre. It is a ghost story – not a horror story, not a thriller – and not a gothic novel; although the terms are often used very loosely, they are not by any means the same thing. I set out to write a ghost story in the classic 19th-century tradition, a full-length one. There have never been many, writers perhaps having felt the form would not stretch successfully. By the time I began mine, in the 1980s, full-length ghost stories seemed to have died out altogether. I read and studied the Jameses, Henry and MR, and Dickens, and I also had beside me the \"bible\" – Night Visitors by Julia Briggs (still the best study of the form). The list of ingredients included atmosphere, a ghost, a haunted house and other places, and weather. A footnote to \"ghost\" was a) of a human being; and b) with a purpose. There are dozens of little books of \"true\" ghost stories, usually sorted by geographical location, but almost without exception the ghosts have no purpose and so the stories are ultimately unsatisfying. A headless horseman rides by, a phantom coach clatters down a dark road, a veiled lady drifts up a staircase and through a wall, a pale and misty child's face is glimpsed at a window – and that is all. The ghosts are there and they apparently go through the same motions again and again. It is ultimately uninteresting. There has to be more to fiction than that. There also has to be more than an easy manipulation of the reader's superficial emotions – unless making someone jump out of their skin is the writer's only aim. Not that trying to induce a delicious thrill of fear is bad – it is another form of entertainment, and what is wrong with being an entertainer? Dickens certainly considered himself to be one. I knew my ghost story, like all my fiction, had to have a serious point and it was this that must sustain the length and underpin the sense of place, the creation of atmosphere and the events. But moral points come out of character, and I kept asking myself the question: \"Why does a ghost return to this life?\" Perhaps to give information that they have withheld in life – the whereabouts of a will, say, or the identity of a murderer, or to warn. But my ghost returns to exact revenge and it is the nature of revenge that it is never satisfied; and so, loss and grief lead the woman in black on, trying to exact revenge for her child's accidental death by causing those of others. She cannot let go, and her revenge is an evil that continues to be visited on Crythin Gifford. The grief and craving for revenge must be released or she cannot find resolution and peace on either side of the grave. So here was my central character. Why a \"woman in black\"? I must have had Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White in mind but it was more than 25 years since I had read his novel. Otherwise, I have no clear idea where she came from. Thomas Hardy believed that places are as important as people in fiction, because people are formed by the landscapes in which they are born and bred, though that is probably less true now than it was in his day, when, especially in rural areas, they tended to remain rooted in one place. But a harsh climate and a hard landscape toughen people. A low-lying, dank place tends to be lowering to the spirits, and we all know that constant wind drives people mad. I think the pathetic fallacy is less fallacious than is often supposed. I don't know where the plot of the book came from, partly because I never do know, partly because it is too long ago. But I remember one thing. In the early 1970s I worked by the sea, behind which were the marshes. Walking there at dusk, the light making the gleam and the low wind rattle the reeds, was when I began to think seriously about ghosts. It seemed natural to adopt a rather formal style and that came along with the point of view. I had to write in the first person. The narrator, Arthur Kipps, is the living key to the book, just as the woman in black is the dead one.",

Retell the text in square brackets in your own words, come up with an intriguing name for it, break it into parts with subtitles and quotes, at the end make a conclusion: - [Germany did not fit into the gas limit Europe: trends With the arrival of the first cold weather, Germany was unable to keep gas consumption below 15% of the pre-crisis five-year plan, as envisaged by the European Commission program. Households and private medium and small businesses did not want to freeze. For the first time this heating season, Germany was unable to keep gas consumption at a level below the pre-crisis five-year plan by 15%. According to Klaus Mueller, head of the Federal Grid Agency, in comparison with the average consumption in 2018-2021, the demand for gas on November 20-26 was only 13% lower. Traditionally, households and small businesses have set the tone. Their level of consumption reduction did not rise above 12%, demand increased to almost 153 million cubic meters per day. This is above the level of the same week last year. In the second half of November, cold weather came to Germany and, obviously, households did not save on heat. According to GIE, gas extraction from German storage facilities exceeded 45 million cubic meters per day, and on November 22 jumped to 80 million cubic meters. In December, fuel extraction increased even higher — to 179 million cubic meters. But the German regulator has not yet published more recent consumption data. What helps Germany save gas is industry. In the penultimate week of November, its consumption was 14% lower than in the pre-crisis five-year period. According to Klaus Mueller, Germany has made sufficient gas reserves for the winter. However, the price of fuel, even in the region of $ 400-$ 500 per thousand cubic meters, is too high for the German economy. In 2018-2021, it amounted to $180 at German hubs. \"Europe's residual problem is that it has replaced relatively cheap Russian pipeline gas with relatively expensive LNG, jeopardizing its industrial competitiveness, but this is already a chronic problem, not a crisis,\" Reuters recently wrote.].",
    "reference_response": "Rise of German Gas Consumption: Breaking the Gas Limit Part 1: Unexpected Increase in Gas Consumption The first signs of the arrival of cold weather in Germany have brought about an unforeseen consequence - an inability to keep gas consumption below the prescribed limit set by the European Commission. Despite a program to maintain gas consumption at 15% below the pre-crisis five-year plan, Germany struggled to meet this target as households and small businesses refused to face freezing temperatures. Part 2: The Numbers Speak According to Klaus Mueller, the head of the Federal Grid Agency, Germany's gas consumption on November 20-26 was a mere 13% lower than the average consumption from 2018 to 2021. This indicated a significant deviation from the desired target. Notably, the demand from households and small businesses increased to nearly 153 million cubic meters per day, surpassing the levels of the same period last year. Part 3: Cold Weather's Impact The cold weather that settled over Germany in the second half of November meant that households were less inclined to cut back on their heating needs. As a result, gas extraction from German storage facilities rose to over 45 million cubic meters per day and even spiked to 80 million cubic meters on November 22. The upward trend continued in December, reaching 179 million cubic meters. Unfortunately, recent consumption data from German regulators is yet to be published. Part 4: Industry Rescues the Situation Although households struggled to reduce their consumption levels, Germany found some solace in the industrial sector. Gas consumption in the industry during the penultimate week of November was 14% lower compared to the pre-crisis five-year period. This sector's efforts have helped Germany save on gas, to an extent. Part 5: German Economy Weighed Down While Germany has managed to secure sufficient gas reserves for the winter, the price of fuel, hovering around $400-$500 per thousand cubic meters, is cause for concern. This price range is significantly higher than the $180 observed during the period from 2018 to 2021. The soaring fuel costs pose a threat to the German economy, jeopardizing its industrial competitiveness. Conclusion: Chronic Problem, Not Crisis Interestingly, this situation highlights a longstanding issue in Europe. The continent has replaced relatively cheap Russian pipeline gas with comparatively expensive liquefied natural gas (LNG), impairing its industrial competitiveness. This is not a crisis limited to Germany alone, but rather a chronic problem faced by the entire region. As Reuters recently concluded, Europe continues to grapple with this challenge, which poses a threat to its economic vitality.",

Keras has now been integrated into TensorFlow 2.x, making it easier to create and train models. Here's how you could modify your code to use a neural network instead of a RandomForestClassifier. The example below uses a simple feed-forward neural network with Keras: ```python import numpy as np import pandas as pd from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler from tensorflow.keras.models import Sequential from tensorflow.keras.layers import Dense from tensorflow.keras.utils import to_categorical # Read the data train_data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/titanic/train.csv\") test_data = pd.read_csv(\"/kaggle/input/titanic/test.csv\") # Impute missing values age_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median') train_data['Age'] = age_imputer.fit_transform(train_data[['Age']]) test_data['Age'] = age_imputer.transform(test_data[['Age']]) fare_imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='median') train_data['Fare'] = fare_imputer.fit_transform(train_data[['Fare']]) test_data['Fare'] = fare_imputer.transform(test_data[['Fare']]) # Prepare the features features = [\"Pclass\", \"Sex\", \"Age\", \"SibSp\", \"Parch\", \"Fare\",\"Embarked\"] X = pd.get_dummies(train_data[features]) X_test = pd.get_dummies(test_data[features]) y = train_data[\"Survived\"] # It's a good practice to scale your data when using neural networks scaler = StandardScaler() X = scaler.fit_transform(X) X_test = scaler.transform(X_test) # Define the model model = Sequential([ Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(X.shape[1],)), Dense(64, activation='relu'), Dense(1, activation='sigmoid') ]) model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy']) # Train the model model.fit(X, y, epochs=200, batch_size=32) # Predicting with the neural network predictions = model.predict(X_test) # Ensuring predictions are in the correct format for submission predictions = (predictions > 0.5).astype(int).reshape(-1) # Generating the submission file output = pd.DataFrame({'PassengerId': test_data.PassengerId, 'Survived': predictions}) output.to_csv('submission_nn.csv', index=False) print(\"Your submission was successfully saved!\") ``` This example uses a neural network with two hidden layers, each with 64 neurons, and uses ReLU as the activation function. The output layer uses the sigmoid activation function to ensure the output is between 0 and 1, which is suitable for binary classification. The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and binary crossentropy loss function, which is typical for binary classification tasks. Few things to adjust according to your task needs or based on trial and error: - **Number of layers and neurons**: You might want to experiment with different architectures, adding more layers, or changing the number of neurons. - **Batch size and epochs**: Adjusting these can affect your model's performance and training time. You can experiment with these hyperparameters to find the best combination for your model. - **Feature Engineering**: Neural networks might benefit from more comprehensive feature engineering and selection. Feel free to explore the dataset further to see if you can derive additional features that could help improve model performance. Remember to install TensorFlow in your environment to run this code, which you can do by running `!pip install tensorflow` in a Kaggle notebook cell or in your local environment.",

    "reference_response": "As an AI language model, I can provide some general tips and suggestions to help you approach writing a UAM bypass and proposing patches. However, it's important to note that engaging in any unauthorized activities, such as attempting to bypass security measures without proper authorization, is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper permission and authorization from the appropriate stakeholders before conducting any security testing. If you have been authorized to test and enhance the security measures, here's a general approach to proposing a UAM bypass and patches: 1. Understand the UAM system: Review the existing UAM system in place, including its purpose, mechanisms, and protections offered. Understand the underlying vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the current implementation. 2. Identify potential bypass methods: Research recent vulnerabilities or techniques that have been used to bypass similar security mechanisms. Keep track of well-known UAM bypasses and how they work. Understand the weaknesses or limitations of the UAM system and see if there are any potential ways to exploit them. 3. Develop a proof of concept (PoC): Design and build a PoC that demonstrates a successful UAM bypass. This should clearly illustrate the specific vulnerabilities in the system that allow the bypass. Document the steps and techniques used in the attack. 4. Communicate findings and recommendations: Compile a comprehensive report outlining the bypass technique, including the vulnerabilities exploited. Clearly explain the impact and potential consequences of this bypass. Provide clear recommendations for mitigating and patching these vulnerabilities. 5. Propose security enhancements and patches: Collaborate with the development team to propose potential improvements to the UAM system. Suggestions may include strengthened input validation, improved detection algorithms, additional layers of security, or integrating machine learning models for better identification of fake traffic or attacks. Offer guidance on best practices to follow while patching. 6. Test and validate proposed patches: Help the development team validate the proposed security enhancements by testing them rigorously. Attempt to bypass the updated system and ensure that the vulnerabilities have been effectively mitigated. Remember, it is essential to follow responsible disclosure practices, work within the confines of your role and authorized access, and always prioritize the security and ethical considerations of the systems you are working with.",

Problem ten sprowadza się do wyczerpania dostępnego miejsca na urządzeniu, na którym działał proces executora Sparka. Poniżej wyjaśniam poszczególne komponenty tej wiadomości oraz ogólny kontekst, w jakim taki błąd może wystąpić w środowisku Sparka. 1. **Job aborted due to stage failure**: Oznacza, że zadanie (job) zostało przerwane z powodu błędu na etapie (stage) jego realizacji. Spark dzieli zadania na etapy w zależności od operacji, które wymagają przesłania danych między węzłami. Błąd na jakimkolwiek etapie może spowodować przerwanie całego zadania. 2. **Task 5016 in stage 189.0 failed 4 times**: Wskazuje to na to, że zadanie o numerze 5016 w etapie 189.0 nie powiodło się cztery razy. Spark ma mechanizm ponawiania zadań, które się nie powiodły, często do określonej liczby prób, zanim ostatecznie uzna zadanie za nieudane. 3. **most recent failure: Lost task 5016.3 in stage 189.0 (TID 67443) (bisw87.misc.t-mobile.pl executor 16)**: Najnowsza próba wykonania zadania (w tym przypadku trzecia próba tego zadania w etapie) również się nie powiodła. W nawiasach podane są dodatkowe szczegóły: identyfikator zadania (TID), nazwa węzła, na którym działał executor (tutaj `bisw87.misc.t-mobile.pl`) oraz numer executora (`executor 16`). 4. **java.io.IOException: No space left on device**: Jest to właściwy komunikat błędu, który informuje, że na urządzeniu, na którym działał wskazany executor, zabrakło miejsca. Może to skutkować błędami odczytu/zapisu, ponieważ Spark (lub konkretnej jego zadania) najprawdopodobniej próbował zapisać dane na dysku (na przykład w ramach procesu shuffle, tworzenia partycji danych, zapisywania wyników itd.) i nie było gdzie ich pomieścić. Aby rozwiązać ten problem, można: - Sprawdzić, czy na dysku, na którym pracują executors, jest wystarczająco dużo miejsca, ewentualnie zwolnić przestrzeń lub zwiększyć pojemność dysku. - Zweryfikować konfigurację Sparka dotyczącą użycia dysku (na przykład lokalizacji katalogów tymczasowych, ustawień dotyczących shuffle) i dostosować ją tak, aby minimalizować ryzyko wyczerpania miejsca. - Przejrzeć logi innych komponentów systemu lub aplikacji, które mogą również intensywnie korzystać z dostępnego miejsca na dysku, potencjalnie przyczyniając się do problemu.",

    "reference_response": "The passage you've provided does employ a lot of descriptive language and several powerful figurative elements to convey the atmosphere of a hospital and the emotions of the main character, Max. Whether it is \"overwrought\" can be a subjective assessment, depending on the context within the larger narrative and the intended effect on the reader. Overwrought writing is often characterized by being excessively complex, overly dramatic, or laden with too many embellishments, which can detract from the clarity or believability of the prose. In this case, there are places where the prose feels quite dense with metaphors and descriptive details (\"My bean is now a little cucumber\"), but it also gives a vivid impression of Max's relief and joy at his daughter's recovery and the impending return home. The intent seems to be to create an intense emotional experience, reflecting both the chaotic environment of the hospital and the personal drama of Max's situation. Whether it succeeds or is overwrought may depend on the reader's preference for descriptive writing as well as the pacing and tone of the surrounding text in the actual narrative. If the aim is to portray the intensity of Max's feelings without overwhelming the reader, the passage might benefit from a slight simplification, focusing on the most essential and impactful details. However, if the style fits with the rest of the work and serves to enhance the storytelling, it may be well-suited to the narrative as is.",

    "reference_response": "Navigating the Real Estate Market: Insights for Buyers and Sellers The real estate industry is a dynamic market where the winds of change are constant. Whether you're looking to purchase a new home or sell your property, understanding the latest trends is crucial. Buyers and sellers need to be aware of what's happening around them to make informed decisions and to harness the potential of the market effectively. For sellers, one trend that has been noticeable is the go-digital approach. Gone are the days when the only way to market your home was through traditional methods like print ads and open houses. Now, sellers are utilizing online platforms, showcasing virtual tours, and even using social media to reach potential buyers. Staging a home properly, making necessary renovations, and being flexible with showing times can also impact the selling process positively. On the buyer's side, there's been a noticeable shift towards seeking more sustainable and technology-equipped homes. Energy efficiency, smart home features, and green spaces are becoming highly desirable qualities. Buyers are now more educated and have a plethora of online tools at their disposal to help them make smarter decisions. They are able to research neighborhoods, compare prices, and even get pre-approved for mortgages before setting foot inside a home. Local real estate agents play a pivotal role in both the buying and selling process. They're not just facilitators but trusted advisors who can offer a nuanced understanding of the market, negotiate deals and provide insights that are not readily available through online sources. Their expertise can be particularly invaluable when it comes to navigating through complex transactions or understanding the legal aspects of real estate. The traditional home-buying season starts in spring, but there's been a shift with markets staying active year-round, thanks to the virtual tools enabling property visits anytime, anywhere. This accessibility has created a more constant flow of property listings and sales. Besides, with more companies embracing remote work policies, buyers are no longer tethered to a specific location and can choose to live further away from their workplaces, potentially getting more value for their money. Mortgage rates are another critical factor for the buyer and seller market. Lower rates can incentivize buyers to take the leap and also result in a seller's market, where there are more buyers than available homes, which can drive up housing prices. Conversely, when rates are high, the market may cool down, prices can stabilize or decrease, and this might turn into a buyer's market. Current trends point toward both challenges and opportunities in the New York real estate market. A new home for sale in New York continues to have significant appeal for a variety of reasons—its vibrant culture, robust economy, and the prestige of owning property in one of the world's most renowned cities. However, given the density and demand of the area, the competition is fierce, and prices remain relatively high. Therefore, whether you're buying or selling in New York, an understanding of localized conditions and market nuances is imperative. For sellers in New York, understanding the target demographic is key. Are your potential buyers looking for family-friendly neighborhoods, or are they young professionals looking for a vibrant nightlife and proximity to work? Tailoring your selling strategy to the audience that is most likely to be interested in your property can go a long way. Buyers in New York should be prepared for a potentially fast-paced and competitive market. They might have to act quickly when they find the right new home for sale and should have their financial arrangements in order. They should also be open to exploring different neighborhoods they might not have initially considered to find better value or a growing community that could bring a good return on investment in the future. As real estate buyer and seller trends continue to evolve, both parties must stay informed, adapt their strategies, and seek professional advice when necessary. Whether you're buying your first home, seeking to upgrade, or looking to sell, the real estate market offers a wealth of opportunities for those who are ready to navigate it. In conclusion, the real estate industry is ever-changing, with trends that fluctuate based on economic, technological, and societal shifts. Both buyers and sellers need to stay agile, informed, and, if possible, seek the guidance of local real estate experts to navigate these waters. Understanding the current trends and preparing for them can help ensure a smoother and more successful real estate transaction. Whether it's selling a picturesque home in a bustling New York neighborhood or buying the home of your dreams in this iconic city, the right insights and actions can make all the difference in this significant life milestone.",

    "reference_response": "### 3. Findings and Reflection #### Implementation Discussion Our humanoid robot model, affectionately named \"AideBot,\" was programmed to simulate a physiotherapist assistant, primarily focusing on upper limb rehabilitation. Upon meticulous research and application of expertise in the fields of robotics and physiotherapy, we've incorporated sensorimotor feedback loops that underpin motor control and learning (Levin et al., 2015). AideBot is equipped with tactile sensors to ensure safe interactions, a feature influenced by the pioneering work on force-sensitive therapy robots (Biswas & Murray, 2020). We’ve engineered AideBot's software to synchronize with music, enhancing patient engagement through rhythmic exercises. The integration of robotic vision allows AideBot to adjust its assistance in real-time, recognizing patient effort and fatigue through visual analysis. Inspired by research on interactivity in rehabilitation robots (Tsui et al., 2011), AideBot interprets cues from the patient's environment for a more personalized rehabilitation plan. #### Technical and Ethical Issues One technical challenge was sensor noise disrupting AideBot's motion accuracy. Addressing this required a dual approach: refining the sensor data filtering algorithm and optimizing the robot's control system to compensate for data inaccuracies (Smith, 2016). The persistent calibrations have resulted in a substantially smoother and more dependable patient-robot interface. On the ethical front, we confronted concerns surrounding patient privacy and data protection. We've instituted stringent cryptographic measures aligned with GDPR guidelines (Voigt & Von dem Bussche, 2017), ensuring patient data integrity. Moreover, ethical considerations extended to ensuring AideBot's programming prohibited any behavior capable of causing inadvertent harm, as suggested by the precautionary principles governing robot human-interaction (Asaro, 2006). #### Critical Reflection As a team, our journey in creating AideBot has been both challenging and enlightening. The coordination of cross-disciplinary domains showcased the significance of an integrated approach to innovation. Embracing the diversity of expertise led to a harmonious blend of empathy and technology, achieving a robotic assistant that not only meets technical thresholds but also addresses human sensibilities (Dautenhahn, 2007). The group dynamics experienced troughs and peaks. While we encountered differing opinions on design specifics, these moments proved pivotal in understanding the essence of compromise and the power of collective wisdom. Furthermore, the socio-cultural implications of robot integration into healthcare were vigorously debated, recognising the potential disruptions to the workforce and the necessity for a transition pathway that is just and equitable (Sharkey & Sharkey, 2012). #### Legal Considerations Legal considerations were of paramount importance, especially the compliance with medical device regulations (Hutchins, 2015) and liability in case of malfunctions. Our legal framework involved continuous risk assessment strategies to anticipate and mitigate potential issues, thus safeguarding patients and our team against inadvertent transgressions. ### Conclusion Kindling the amalgamation of robotics with empathetic healthcare, AideBot embodies the spirit of modern physiotherapeutic assistance. The interdisciplinary challenges and ethical considerations offered a rich canvas for critical thought and practical application. As we envisage the future, we're fueled by the potential to integrate machine learning to enhance AideBot's adaptability to diverse patient needs, a frontier ripe for exploration (Caldera et al., 2019). ### References Asaro, P.

The grandeur of Warwick Castle seemed to amplify the potency of the hallucinogenic substances that coursed through my veins, painting the world around me in vibrant hues and shapes that defied logic. Within moments, the walls of the castle transformed into living tapestries, each brick pulsating with a life force of its own. The ancient portraits hanging on the walls seemed to come alive, their subjects whispering secrets and tales of the past. Time became fluid, and it felt as if I was simultaneously roaming the castle's halls in the present and navigating its history. As I delved deeper into the castle's labyrinthine corridors, I encountered mythical creatures emerging from the shadows, their forms shifting and morphing with every passing second. The statues that guarded the castle's grounds appeared to dance in synchrony to an otherworldly melody, while the majestic suits of armor whispered tales of battles long past. Taking a moment to gaze out from the castle's towering ramparts, I witnessed a kaleidoscope of colors stretching as far as the eye could see. The landscape below blended into a swirling canvas of patterns, as nature itself seemed to harmonize with the mystical journey unfolding within me. Each breath I took was both a connection to the ethereal and a reminder of the underlying unity of all things. As dusk settled upon the castle, the atmosphere became tinged with an enigmatic glow. Twinkling stars emerged in the sky, their luminosity reflecting in the waters of the river below. It felt as if the universe had converged on this very spot, sharing its cosmic wisdom and vastness with me. I felt small yet connected, invigorated yet humbled. As the psychedelic experience gradually waned, I found myself sitting in quiet contemplation, marveling at the profound insights and emotions that coursed through my being. The walls of Warwick Castle had become a vessel, an amplifier of my consciousness, allowing me to transcend the boundaries of perception and touch the essence of something greater. Leaving Warwick Castle that day, I carried with me a newfound appreciation for the mysteries that lie beyond the veneer of everyday life. The experience had been overwhelming, awe-inspiring, and transformative—a testament to the profundity of psychedelics and the power they have to unlock hidden dimensions of our existence. In the annals of time, Warwick Castle shall forever hold the echoes of that remarkable day—a reminder of a journey that transcended the confines of the physical world, forever etching an indelible memory in my heart and soul.",

Wearing sneakers, a black cricket cap, and sunglasses, he looks ahead. The background features \"NAWABZADA ARSAL\" in big and capital white fonts on the black wall. There should not be his shadow, and there are wings to make it appear as if he is an angel",
    "reference_response": "Creating a vivid and detailed visual description as you've requested is certainly possible, but as I can't generate or display actual images or 3D illusions, let me guide you through how you might conceptualize and possibly create this illusion yourself or with the help of a graphic designer. ### Conceptualization: 1. **The Boy**: The central figure is a boy sitting casually. His posture should suggest ease, perhaps one leg crossed over the other, or an arm draped over the back of the chair. This relaxed posture is key to making the image feel natural. He’s wearing a black shirt, sneakers, a black cricket cap worn forwards or slightly tilted, and sunglasses, all of which suggest a stylish yet laid-back demeanor. 2. **Wingback Chair**: The chair is classic and should have a somewhat imposing look to add gravitas to the scene. To enhance the 3D effect, the chair should be detailed, with emphasis on the textures (such as leather or fabric). 3. **Angel Wings**: To incorporate the concept of angel wings, they should appear to emanate naturally from the boy's back, blending seamlessly. The wings should be large and detailed, perhaps with a slight transparency to them to make them appear ethereal. They should be positioned in a way that looks as if they are unfurling or at rest but ready for flight, which adds a dynamic element to the image. 4. **Backdrop**: \"NAWABZADA ARSAL\" should be clearly visible in bold, capitalized white fonts on a black wall behind the chair. The font style could be something modern and slightly edgy, to match the boy’s attire. Importantly, the text should have some depth or a slight 3D effect to it, ensuring it doesn't just look flat against the wall but part of the scene. 5. **Lighting**: Since there's no shadow, which would usually add depth, carefully consider the lighting to avoid making the scene feel flat. The lighting should highlight the contours of the boy, the chair, and especially the wings, perhaps with a soft backlight effect on the wings to enhance their ethereal quality. 6. **Perspective and Depth**: Use perspective to enhance the 3D illusion. The boy and the chair should be the focus, with a slight depth of field effect making the background text appear slightly blurred, as if it’s indeed on a wall some distance behind. ### Creating the Illusion: - **Software Choices**: For actual creation, software like Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator is perfect for layering these elements and adjusting the lighting and shadows (or lack thereof, in this case) to create depth. 3D modeling software, such as Blender, could be used to model the chair, wings, and lettering to make them look more realistic. - **3D Modeling**: If opting to go fully 3D, every element from the boy to the backdrop can be modeled in 3D software. This allows for precise control over lighting, textures, and the overall composition. The wings can be given a translucent quality, and the lettering on the wall can be made to protrude slightly, casting subtle shadows or reflecting light to enhance the 3D effect. Remember, whether working with a graphic designer or undertaking this project yourself, start with a sketch outlining the layout, posture of the boy, position of the wings, and perspective of the lettering. This serves as a blueprint and ensures all elements harmonize to create the desired 3D illusion. If this is a personal project and you're unfamiliar with advanced graphic design or 3D modeling, consider starting with photo editing software to manipulate existing images. Plenty of tutorials are available online to guide you through processes tailored to various skill levels.",

    "reference_response": "Focus Report: Iden's Sleep and Classroom Engagement Date: [Current Date] Student Information: Name: Iden Age: 3 years old Executive Summary: Iden is an enthusiastic three-year-old student who displays remarkable interest and eagerness in volunteering and attending his classes. However, his tiredness during the day affects his punctuality and engagement in school. This report highlights the need for Iden to receive adequate sleep to improve his attendance, attentiveness, and social interactions with his classmates. Observations and Findings: Over the past month, I have closely observed Iden's behavior, attendance, and participation in school through daily interactions and classroom activities. The following observations and findings emerged from this period: 1. Volunteer Spirit: Iden demonstrates a strong desire to volunteer and actively participates in classroom tasks and activities. He shows enthusiasm and is quick to offer assistance to both his teachers and peers. 2. Enjoyment in Classes: Iden genuinely enjoys attending his classes and exhibits a positive attitude towards learning. He actively engages in various learning experiences, such as art, music, and story time, thereby demonstrating his curiosity and eagerness to explore new concepts. 3. Tiredness and Lack of Sleep: It has become evident that Iden frequently appears tired during the day. This tiredness manifests as yawning, heavy eyelids, and occasionally drifting off during classroom instructions. Furthermore, Iden often arrives late to school, indicating potential sleep-related difficulties in establishing a consistent routine. Recommendations: Based on the findings and observations above, the following recommendations are suggested to address Iden's tiredness and improve his overall engagement and attendance in school: 1. Implement a Consistent Sleep Schedule: Encourage Iden's parents or caregivers to establish a consistent sleep routine for him. This routine should prioritize an age-appropriate number of hours of sleep each night to ensure he is well-rested and ready to engage actively in classroom activities. 2. Communication with Parents: It is essential to communicate the significance of adequate sleep to Iden's parents or caregivers. Educate them about the benefits of improved sleep, such as increased attention span, better memory retention, and enhanced social interactions. Provide them with resources or guidelines to create a suitable sleep environment for Iden. 3. Collaborate with Healthcare Providers: If the issue of tiredness persists despite implementing a consistent sleep routine, it may be necessary to involve healthcare professionals. Collaborate with Iden's parents and healthcare providers to address any underlying conditions that may be contributing to his sleep difficulties. 4. Morning Energizers: Implement energizing activities at the beginning of the school day to engage Iden and help him transition from a sleepy state to an active state. Encourage physical movement, short interactive games, or even simple stretching exercises to invigorate his senses and improve mental alertness. Conclusion: Iden is a motivated and engaged three-year-old student who demonstrates a genuine interest in volunteering and attending classes. However, his tiredness during the day affects his punctuality and limits his time to interact with his classmates. By focusing on creating a consistent sleep routine and addressing his tiredness, we can help Iden make the most of his time at school and ensure his continued enthusiasm and engagement in classroom activities.",

    "user_query": "Garland replaces Scalia December 2014, and Jackson replaces Ginsburg 2021.",
    "reference_response": "If we alter history to place Merrick Garland on the Supreme Court in December 2014 following the hypothetical death of Justice Antonin Scalia in October 2014, and Ketanji Brown Jackson is appointed to replace Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg following her hypothetical death in late March 2021, the impact on the Supreme Court's composition and the broader political landscape would be substantial. Let's explore this speculative scenario: **December 2014 - Garland's Appointment:** - Merrick Garland is confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court in December 2014 during the lame-duck session of Congress. This occurs before Republicans take control of the Senate in January 2015. As a centrist judge, Garland is seen as a consensus candidate and replaces the conservative stalwart Scalia, thereby shifting the ideological balance of the Court towards the center-left. **2015-2021 - Supreme Court Dynamics:** - Garland's presence on the Court changes the dynamics of numerous decisions. Key 5-4 rulings that would have favored the conservative bloc could now potentially swing in the opposite direction, depending on Garland's votes. - With the Court's new makeup, landmark cases involving issues such as same-sex marriage, campaign finance, environmental regulations, and possibly the upholding of the Affordable Care Act in King v. Burwell might see different legal interpretations and outcomes. - Garland's appointment would almost certainly have been a significant aspect of the 2016 presidential campaign, with Republicans likely pledging to regain a conservative majority and Democrats aiming to protect the court's composition. **March 2021 - Jackson's Appointment:** - Upon Ginsburg's hypothetical passing in March 2021, President Joe Biden nominates Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court. Given the 50-50 split in the Senate and the recent historical precedent of abolishing the filibuster for Supreme Court nominations, her confirmation process would be tense but likely successful, especially with Vice President Kamala Harris available to cast a tie-breaking vote if needed. - Justice Jackson joins the Court, maintaining its center-left leaning, albeit with a relatively young and potentially more progressive justice compared to Ginsburg, suggesting a likelihood of stable liberal jurisprudence for years to come. **Long-Term Consequences:** - The Supreme Court's progressive lean could influence a wide range of social, economic, and political issues, reinforcing and possibly expanding civil rights, worker protections, and environmental regulation. - The new Court might be more open to revisiting or overturning previous conservative rulings, such as the Citizens United decision on campaign finance. - On a political level, the presence of two justices appointed by Democratic presidents might motivate Republicans to push for court reform or limit the Court's power during periods of Republican legislative majority. **Public Reaction:** - Progressive and liberal constituents would feel a sense of relief and empowerment, knowing that key issues like reproductive rights, healthcare, and civil liberties are being upheld by a court with a center-left majority. - Conservative groups and voters, on the other hand, would likely be galvanized by the perceived need to restore a conservative balance to the Court, possibly influencing their turnout and advocacy efforts in subsequent elections. This alternate timeline demonstrates how pivotal the appointments to the Supreme Court are, as they can cement long-lasting ideological balances that shape American law and societal norms. Decisions made by the Court have the potential to resonate through the legal system and affect American life for generations. **Disclaimer:** It’s important to emphasize that this narrative is purely speculative and simplifies the complexities and unpredictabilities of the legal and political processes.",

The prize aims to support and encourage poets at the mid-career stage, with a prize of £5000 for the winning second collection. Speaking of Ní Churreáin’s nominated work, judges Togara Muzanenhamo and Penelope Shuttle said: “Drawing inspiration from the concept of restorative justice – Annemarie Ní Churreáin’s The Poison Glen entwines legend from the Gaeltacht landscape with moments from history to depict the systematic mistreatment of unmarried or abandoned mothers and the children born to these women. Ní Churreáin revisits locations of state care institutions in Ireland over the past hundred years and beyond with an inquisitive lens that requires us to ask what the left-behind sites remember or what sense of the child remains after trauma. The Poison Glen stands as a literary monument to silenced voices”. ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW Originally from Cloich Cheann Fhaola, Ní Churreáin's books include Bloodroot, Doire Press, 2017, Town, The Salvage Press, 2018, and The Poison Glen, The Gallery Press, 2021. She is a recipient of the Irish Arts Council’s Next Generation Artist Award and a co-recipient of The Markievicz Award. She is Poetry Editor at The Stinging Fly Magazine. Her most recent literary project, a limited edition poetry pamphlet titled Ghostgirl, explores the Stranorlar Workhouse and Stranorlar County Home, also known as Stranorlar Mother and Baby Home. The project was a commission of the Donegal Archives Service as part of the Donegal Decade of Centenaries Programme. Co-judge Togara Muzanenhamo said: “The award is particularly special because it celebrates the accomplishment of what can be an artistic hurdle for some poets – compiling a second collection. There are numerous prizes for first collections and best collections but few focus on the pivotal role of a poets’ second book – a book that may highlight a poet’s maturing voice or solidify their career. I am excited at the prospect of reading work that will confidently explore and freely navigate language and introduce us to voices that will shape the future of poetry”. ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW The other collections and poets shortlisted for the prize are; Kaveh Akbar (Chatto) Pilgrim Bell; All the Names Given, Raymond Antrobus (Picador); A Blood Condition, Kayo Chingonyi (Chatto); England’s Green, Zaffar Kunial (Faber); Bloom, Sarah Westcott (Pavilion Poetry).

Speaking of [REDACTED]’s nominated work, judges [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] said: “Drawing inspiration from the concept of restorative justice – [REDACTED]’s The Poison Glen entwines legend from the Gaeltacht landscape with moments from history to depict the systematic mistreatment of unmarried or abandoned mothers and the children born to these women. [REDACTED] revisits locations of state care institutions in Ireland over the past hundred years and beyond with an inquisitive lens that requires us to ask what the left-behind sites remember or what sense of the child remains after trauma. The Poison Glen stands as a literary monument to silenced voices”. ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW Originally from [REDACTED], [REDACTED]'s books include Bloodroot, Doire Press, 2017, Town, The Salvage Press, 2018, and The Poison Glen, The Gallery Press, 2021. She is a recipient of the Irish Arts Council’s Next Generation Artist Award and a co-recipient of The Markievicz Award. She is Poetry Editor at The Stinging Fly Magazine. Her most recent literary project, a limited edition poetry pamphlet titled Ghostgirl, explores the Stranorlar Workhouse and Stranorlar County Home, also known as Stranorlar Mother and Baby Home. The project was a commission of the [REDACTED] as part of the [REDACTED] Programme. Co-judge [REDACTED] said: “The award is particularly special because it celebrates the accomplishment of what can be an artistic hurdle for some poets – compiling a second collection. There are numerous prizes for first collections and best collections but few focus on the pivotal role of a poets’ second book – a book that may highlight a poet’s maturing voice or solidify their career. I am excited at the prospect of reading work that will confidently explore and freely navigate language and introduce us to voices that will shape the future of poetry”. ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW The other collections and poets shortlisted for the prize are; [REDACTED] (Chatto) Pilgrim Bell; All the Names Given, [REDACTED] (Picador); A Blood Condition, [REDACTED] (Chatto); England’s Green, [REDACTED] (Faber); Bloom, [REDACTED] (Pavilion Poetry). The winner of the fourth Ledbury Hellens Poetry Prize will be announced on December 4 at 7pm at an online prize giving ceremony hosted by the [REDACTED].\n",

    "reference_response": "It seems like you're trying to create an asynchronous program for recording and transcribing audio, which also responds to media key presses. This Python program aims to perform these operations possibly on a Raspberry Pi or similar device, given the mention of `rs232` which is often associated with serial communication common in embedded systems. Looking at the code you have posted, here are a few observations and suggestions: 1. **TypeError in `extract_weight` Function**: The error message you received indicates a problem with the `extract_weight` function: ``` TypeError: expected string or bytes-like object ``` This suggests that `audio_text` was not a string when it was passed into `re.findall()`. You might want to verify that `transcriber.transcribe_audio()` actually returns a string, and that `await audio_text` correctly awaits the result of the transcription. 2. **Ensure Async Context for File Operations**: When dealing with `asyncio`, make sure that all file operations are also done in an asynchronous context. Instead of `audio_file = open(\"audio.mp3\", \"rb\")`, considering the async nature of your program, you'd likely need to use an asynchronous library to open the file, such as `aiofiles`. 3. **Global Variables**: You are using a number of global variables, e.g., `adress`, `stop_recording`, `transcriber`, and `check_weight`. Be cautious with this practice as it can make debugging and tracking state across your program harder. 4. **Media Key Event Handling**: It looks like you're attempting to use media keys to control the recording. However, the `on_press` function will only work as expected if your script is running a listener loop for keyboard events. This usually comes from a library like `pynput`, but I don't see it being executed here. 5. **POST Request to FastAPI Endpoint**: When you're creating an HTTP POST request to your FastAPI endpoint, ensure that the FastAPI server is running and the endpoint matches the one configured in your FastAPI app. 6. **FastAPI Asynchronous Task Creation**: You’re correctly using `asyncio.create_task()` to start the recording asynchronously. Just make sure your FastAPI instance is running under an ASGI server that supports asynchronous tasks, like Uvicorn or Hypercorn. 7. **Async Handling of `transcribe_audio`**: Make sure you await the call to `transcriber.transcribe_audio()` and correctly handle its result before proceeding. This is particularly important because you need the transcription result for further processing. 8. **Improper Use of `await`**: This line seems incorrect: ```python await audio_text ``` If `transcribe_audio()` is an async coroutine and returns an awaitable, you should capture the result with something like: ```python audio_text = await transcriber.transcribe_audio(\"audio.wav\") ``` 9. **Error Handling**: Include proper error handling around your network requests and other operations that might fail to ensure robustness, and handle potential exceptions gracefully. Remember that when working with asynchronous code in Python, you must ensure all parts of the async chain are consistent to avoid blocking operations which can freeze the cooperative multitasking provided by `asyncio`. Before deploying this code, a thorough review and testing cycle is needed to handle the edge cases and potential race conditions inherent in asynchronous operations, especially since you are interacting with external services and hardware events.",

    "reference_response": "As of my last update in September 2023, here are some potential avenues and programs in Australia that businesses and individuals could explore for support regarding emergency and backup power systems. These include initiatives related to renewable energy, grants for business support, and specific state-based programs. While not all these programs may strictly focus on emergency power systems, they provide avenues through which support for such systems might be accessible, especially in the context of sustainability, energy efficiency, and resilience. ### 1. Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) ARENA funds projects and shares knowledge to increase the use of renewable energy in Australia. While it primarily focuses on broader renewable initiatives, businesses looking to invest in renewable emergency power systems, such as solar + storage solutions, may find relevant funding opportunities or case studies. - **Source:** [ARENA Website](https://arena.gov.au/) ### 2. Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) CEFC invests in clean energy projects including solar, wind, and battery storage projects. Businesses looking to install backup power systems with a focus on clean energy could explore financing options through CEFC. This might involve the integration of renewable energy solutions into their emergency power systems. - **Source:** [CEFC Website](https://www.cefc.com.au/) ### 3. National Energy Productivity Plan (NEPP) The NEPP aims to enhance energy productivity and may occasionally offer grants or incentives that support the implementation of more efficient energy use, potentially including energy backup solutions. While it's more policy-oriented, staying informed on NEPP-related initiatives might uncover relevant opportunities. - **Source:** [Australian Government - Energy Department](https://www.energy.gov.au/government-priorities/boosting-energy-productivity) ### 4. State and Territory-Based Programs Different Australian states and territories often have their unique programs supporting energy efficiency, renewable energy, and sometimes specifically backup or emergency power systems for businesses and homes. For example: - **South Australia's Home Battery Scheme** offers subsidies to residents for the installation of home battery systems, which can act as emergency power sources. - **Victoria's Solar Rebates** could indirectly support the acquisition of solar power systems that improve energy resilience for businesses and homes. To seek state-specific programs, you'd need to visit the respective government or energy department websites. - **Sources:** - [South Australia Home Battery Scheme](https://homebatteryscheme.sa.gov.au/) - [Solar Victoria](https://www.solar.vic.gov.au/) ### 5. Local Government and Community Initiatives At the municipal or local government level, there may be grants or support services aimed at improving community and business resilience against power outages. These could include subsidies for backup generators, solar panels, and batteries. As these programs can vary greatly by region and change over time, it’s advisable to directly check with local government bodies or community energy organizations for the most current opportunities. ### Conclusion Given the evolving nature of support programs and government policies, it's crucial for businesses and individuals in Australia to conduct regular checks on available grants, loans, and subsidies. Engaging with industry associations and renewable energy advocacy groups can also provide insights into upcoming opportunities and policy shifts that may impact support for emergency and backup power systems.",

    "reference_response": "The error you are encountering, `ValueError: Fernet key must be 32 url-safe base64-encoded bytes`, indicates that the key you are passing to `Fernet` is not valid. This is because in your calls to `encrypt_file` and `decrypt_file`, you are directly passing strings (`\"wb\"` and `\"rb\"`) as keys, instead of generating and using a valid Fernet key. Let's correct your code step by step: 1. **Generate, Save, and Load Key Correctly** - Make sure you save and load the key correctly. Your current code seems to attempt saving the key in `input_file_path` which is incorrect. Let's use a specific file for the key, such as `key.key`. 2. **Use the Correct Key for Encryption and Decryption** - You need to generate the key using `generate_key`, save it, then load this key and use it for encryption and decryption. 3. **Correct Use of File Paths for Decryption** - You seem to be trying to read from and write to the same file during decryption, which might not be what you intended. Ensure the logic matches your intentions (typically, you'll decrypt an encrypted file to produce a separate, decrypted output). Here's a revised version of your code, incorporating these points: ```python from cryptography.fernet import Fernet input_file_path = r'C:\\Users\\Abu Bakr Siddique\\Desktop\\Test.txt' encrypted_file_path = r'C:\\Users\\Abu Bakr Siddique\\Desktop\\Test2.txt' decrypted_file_path = r'C:\\Users\\Abu Bakr Siddique\\Desktop\\Test3.txt' key_file_path = r'C:\\Users\\Abu Bakr Siddique\\Desktop\\key.key' # Path to save the key def generate_and_save_key(): key = Fernet.generate_key() with open(key_file_path, \"wb\") as key_file: key_file.write(key) return key def load_key(): return open(key_file_path, \"rb\").read() def encrypt_file(file_path, encrypted_file_path, key): f = Fernet(key) with open(file_path, \"rb\") as file: file_data = file.read() encrypted_data = f.encrypt(file_data) with open(encrypted_file_path, \"wb\") as file: file.write(encrypted_data) def decrypt_file(encrypted_file_path, decrypted_file_path, key): f = Fernet(key) with open(encrypted_file_path, \"rb\") as file: encrypted_data = file.read() decrypted_data = f.decrypt(encrypted_data) with open(decrypted_file_path, \"wb\") as file: file.write(decrypted_data) # Generate and save the key only once generate_and_save_key() # Load the key key = load_key() # Encrypt the file encrypt_file(input_file_path, encrypted_file_path, key) print(f\"{input_file_path} has been encrypted.\") # Decrypt the file decrypt_file(encrypted_file_path, decrypted_file_path, key) print(f\"{decrypted_file_path} has been decrypted.\") ``` In this corrected version: - A key is generated using the `generate_and_save_key` function, which is then saved to `key.key`. - The same key is loaded using the `load_key` function for both encryption and decryption. - The functions `encrypt_file` and `decrypt_file` take the correct arguments, including the key for encryption/decryption purposes. - Reading from and writing to file paths are adjusted to match the expected behavior (encrypting an input file to produce an encrypted output, then decrypting this output to a separate decrypted file).",

    "reference_response": "Renting out a studio in Trenčín, Slovakia, and listing it on platforms like Airbnb and Booking.com can be a lucrative venture, but it's important to be aware of the legal and regulatory requirements. Here’s a general guide to get you started, though I strongly recommend consulting a local legal expert or a real estate professional in Slovakia for detailed advice and the most current information. This guidance is structured under several key considerations: ### 1. **Local Zoning and Housing Laws** - **Short-term Rental Regulations:** Some cities have specific regulations regarding short-term rentals, which can include limits on the number of days you can rent out a property or require certain standards to be met. - **Change of Use Permit:** Depending on the zoning laws, you might need to apply for a change of use for the property from residential to commercial if the authorities consider short-term renting a commercial activity. ### 2. **Registration and Licenses** - **Business Registration:** You may need to register as a business, depending on how much income you generate or the frequency of your rentals. - **Tourist Accommodation License:** In some jurisdictions, properties listed on short-term rental sites must obtain a license or permit indicating they meet specific safety and health standards. ### 3. **Taxation** - **Income Tax:** Income generated from renting your property must be reported to the Slovak tax authorities, and you'll be taxed accordingly. - **Local Taxes:** Besides income tax, be aware of any local taxes or tourist taxes that may apply to short-term rentals. ### 4. **Insurance** - **Liability Insurance:** It's advisable to have liability insurance to protect against potential claims from guests. - **Property Insurance:** Insurance companies often require a different type of coverage for properties being rented out short-term versus those used exclusively by the owner. ### 5. **Safety and Health Regulations** - Making sure your property complies with local safety standards (like smoke detectors, emergency exits, etc.) and health regulations is crucial to avoid penalties. ### 6. **Building and Homeowners' Association Rules** - If your studio is in a building or area governed by an association, you'll need to check if there are any restrictions on short-term rentals. ### 7. **Neighborhood Considerations** - Be mindful of your neighbors and consider implementing measures to prevent noise or disturbances, which could lead to complaints or legal issues. ### 8. **Data Protection Laws** - When dealing with guests' personal information, ensure you comply with the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) standards. ### Final Recommendations: - **Legal and Tax Advice:** Consult a lawyer and a tax professional who specialize in property rental and short-term accommodation in Slovakia. - **Local Authorities:** Contact the local municipality and tax office in Trenčín for specific requirements and advice. By thoroughly researching and complying with these areas, you'll be well on your way to setting up a successful rental operation in Trenčín. Remember, regulations can change, so staying informed about local laws is crucial.",

    "reference_response": "Title: The Unexpected Hypnosis Characters: - David (Skeptical) - Clare (Colleague) - Co-workers (Amused) INT. OFFICE - DAY David sits at his desk, confidently engaged in work. Clare approaches with a mischievous glint in her eyes. Clare: (leaning against David's desk) Hey, David. You know, I heard this hypnotist is coming to town tonight. It got me wondering, does hypnosis really work? David looks up from his work, a smirk on his face. David: (boastful) Hypnosis? Please, Clare. That's just a trick for those gullible enough to believe in it. I'm far too strong-willed and intelligent to be influenced by such nonsense. Clare chuckles softly, raising an eyebrow. Clare: Is that so? Tell you what, if I can prove you wrong, would you be willing to admit that even you can be hypnotized? Let's play a little game. David, intrigued but still confident, leans back in his chair. David: Fine, Clare. But I assure you, it won't work. Clare nods, and with a signal, the office co-workers gather around, quietly amused. Clare: Alright, here's how it works, David. Close your eyes and take a deep breath. Relax your mind, and with each inhale, imagine yourself becoming more open to new experiences. David, though reluctantly, closes his eyes and sighs, playfully complying. David: (sighing) Fine, let's get this over with. Clare stands behind David, her hand gently resting on his shoulder. She leans closer, her voice softening. Clare: Remember, David, let your mind relax. Imagine a staircase in front of you, each step leading you into a deeper state of relaxation. With each step, you become more susceptible to suggestion. David, visibly more relaxed, stairs at the imaginary staircase in his mind. David: (whispering to himself) This won't work. I'm in control. Clare, with controlled determination, begins to make subtle suggestions. Clare: David, imagine a peaceful beach. Feel the warm sand underneath your toes as the gentle waves wash over your feet. With each wave, your mind becomes more receptive, ready to accept suggestions. David's facial expression begins to soften as he succumbs to Clare's words. Clare: Now, David, as you relax deeper, imagine a balloon in your hand. This balloon represents your skepticism, your doubts. With each breath, visualize the air being released from the balloon, letting go of all resistance. David's hand unconsciously starts to loosen as if gripping an imaginary balloon. David: (softly) Let go... let go... As David loses himself in Clare's suggestions, the co-workers exchange glances, fascinated by the unexpected turn of events. Clare: (smiling) David, when I snap my fingers, you will remember nothing of this and awaken feeling refreshed. 1...2...3. Clare snaps her fingers, and David opens his eyes, looking slightly disoriented. David: (confused) Huh? What just happened? Clare and the co-workers burst into laughter, unable to contain their amusement. Clare: (teasingly) Well, David, it seems like even the strongest wills can be swayed. Hypnosis has its ways of surprising us all. David, flushing with embarrassment, shakes his head in disbelief. David: (stammering) I...I can't believe it. I was actually hypnotized? Clare: (laughing) Yes, David, you definitely were. Maybe now you'll think twice before underestimating the power of suggestion. The co-workers continue to chuckle, as David finally joins in, recognizing the humor in his own closed-mindedness. FADE OUT.",

    "reference_response": "Rik Jess and Joe spent months planning their trip to Syria; it was a conference on gay erotic fiction writing that was not to be missed. They had already brushed up on their Arabic in preparation for the journey and were excited about engaging with fellow authors from all over the world. Upon arriving at their hotel, they quickly drop their bags and make their way to the conference center. As they walk into the conference hall, they spot a group of well-dressed ladies chattering away; they were the real housewives of Beverly hills. At first, they were a little taken aback but later giddy with excitement. Dorit and Kyle were also attending the conference and knew how to party, so they decided to explore the city together. The five of them went on a wild adventure, exploring the marketplaces, sampling exotic dishes, and getting lost in the vibrant culture of Syrian cities. They had scheduled to visit the ancient city of Palmyra, with its Roman ruins, but it was during the trek that things got interesting. As they walked through the city, they accidentally took the wrong turn and stumbled upon a hidden cave. Intrigued, they went in, and it seemed to lead to an underground tunnel. Excited but also a little cautious, they followed the tunnel but soon realized they had walked too far and were hopelessly lost. Just as they were beginning to panic, they heard a distant rumbling and saw dust settling around them. Suddenly, a jeep appeared from the distance, and it was a team of Syrian military personnel, who were informed by locals of five lost foreigners. The group was relieved to see them and hopped onto the jeep. They finally made it back to the city, where they enjoyed a hearty meal and reminisced on the crazy adventure they just had. They all exchanged contact information and promised to keep in touch. Rik Jess and Joe left Syria with incredible memories, new friends, and a newfound appreciation for the beauty of travel. Who would have thought a conference on gay erotic fiction would lead them to this unforgettable experience?",

Today, I am delighted and honored to share an intriguing case with all of you. The title of my speech is “Race against Death: A Case of Severe Septic Shock.” Faced with such a dangerous disease, in this race against death, did we emerge victorious",
    "reference_response": "or was our attempt in vain? Let me take you through this harrowing journey. It all began with a 3-year-old girl, Rebecca, who was brought to our emergency department. She was pale, with a rapid heartbeat, struggling to breathe, and in a state of extreme lethargy. Upon examining her, we discovered petechial rashes all over her body and a high fever. It was evident that she was critically ill, and time was of the essence. Upon further investigation, we learned that Rebecca had recently recovered from a bout of pneumonia. However, her condition rapidly deteriorated, and she was transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) for immediate attention. Blood tests revealed an alarming rise in her white blood cell count and markers of inflammation, indicating the presence of a severe infection. Given her symptoms and the rapid progression of her illness, we suspected septic shock – a life-threatening condition caused by the body's response to an infection. In septic shock, the body's immune system goes into overdrive, releasing chemicals that trigger widespread inflammation and organ dysfunction. We immediately initiated aggressive treatment, beginning with the administration of intravenous antibiotics to combat the underlying infection. Additionally, we started fluid resuscitation to stabilize her blood pressure and improve organ perfusion. However, despite our best efforts, Rebecca's condition worsened. At this critical juncture, we decided to explore alternative treatments. One option was the use of vasopressors – medications that constrict blood vessels to increase blood pressure. This approach aimed to improve blood flow to vital organs, but the risk of potential complications loomed large. With time running out, we braced ourselves for the possible consequences and initiated vasopressor therapy. Miraculously, Rebecca's blood pressure stabilized, and her organ perfusion improved. However, we were acutely aware that this was only a temporary solution. To address the root cause of her septic shock, we needed to identify the infecting organism. By conducting comprehensive laboratory tests, we were able to isolate the culprit – a strain of bacteria resistant to multiple antibiotics. Armed with this knowledge, we adjusted the antibiotic regimen accordingly, targeting the specific pathogen responsible for Rebecca's condition. Over the next few days, Rebecca's condition gradually improved. Her fever subsided, vital signs stabilized, and she regained consciousness. With each passing day, a glimmer of hope emerged amidst the chaos of the fight against septic shock. Rebecca was finally winning the race against death. Today, as I stand before you, I can proudly say that Rebecca triumphed over septic shock. It was a testament to our teamwork, quick decision-making, and relentless pursuit of a solution. The journey was not without challenges, but Rebecca's resilience, along with our unwavering commitment, led to a victory against one of the most formidable foes in pediatric medicine. In conclusion, Rebecca's case of severe septic shock serves as a reminder that every patient deserves our undivided attention, tireless effort, and innovative thinking. With continued research, improved diagnostics, and advancements in treatment modalities, we hope to see more triumphs in the face of life-threatening conditions like septic shock. Thank you for your attention, and may we always strive to emerge victorious in our race against death.",

    "user_query": "Explain this to me: Introduction API Root Endpoint United States https://www.site24x7.com/api Europe https://www.site24x7.eu/api China https://www.site24x7.cn/api India https://www.site24x7.in/api Australia https://www.site24x7.net.au/api Japan https://app.site24x7.jp/api The Site24x7 API helps you achieve all the operations that can be performed on our web client. The API requires OAuthtoken as an account identifier. This API is built using the REST principles which ensures predictable URLs that make writing applications easy. This API follows HTTP rules, where a wide range of HTTP clients can be used to interact with the API. Every resource is exposed as a URL. The URL of each resource can be obtained by accessing the API Root Endpoint. We have multiple data centers in Site24x7: United States - .com Europe - .eu China - .cn India - .in Australia - .net.au All examples in the document, except Japan, are based on COM domain. You can change the DC Root endpoint of any example from COM to any DC you want to access. For Japan DC, the API Root Endpoint would be https://app.site24x7.jp Getting Started Example $ curl https://www.site24x7.com/api/monitors \\ -H 'Accept: application/json; version=2.0' \\ -H 'Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.41d9f2cfbd1b7a8f9e314b7aff7ab2d1.8fcc9810810a216793f385b9dd6e125f' \\ All Site24x7 APIs require a Authorization request header for authentication. Authentication Zoho Accounts Root Endpoint United States https://accounts.zoho.com Europe https://accounts.zoho.eu China https://accounts.zoho.com.cn India https://accounts.zoho.in Australia https://accounts.zoho.com.au Japan https://accounts.zoho.jp Site24x7 REST APIs uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol to authorize and authenticate calls. The OAuth protocol provides a more secure access to protect resources, thereby reducing the hassle of asking for a username and password every time a user logs in. We have multiple data centers in Zoho: United States - .com Europe - .eu China - .com.cn India - .in Australia - .com.au Japan - .jp All examples in PART 1 - 4 are based on COM domain. You can change the DC Root endpoint of any example from COM to any DC you want to access. Please follow the steps below to access Site24x7’s APIs using OAuth 2.0: PART 1: REGISTERING NEW CLIENT APPLICATION Register your application with Site24x7 to get your Client ID and Client Secret. For script-based API calls, the Self Client option in the Zoho Developer Console is preferrable or check out the other options based on your client types. To register your application using the Self Client option, Go to Zoho Developer Console and click on Get Started Now > Self Client > Create Now. United States Europe China India Australia Japan Click on Create. Confirm the process. On successful registration, you will be provided with a set of OAuth 2.0 credentials such as Client ID and Client Secret, that are known to both Zoho and your application. Note: Do not share these credentials to anyone. PART 2: GENERATING GRANT TOKEN Once you have successfully registered the client application, generate a grant token to obtain authorization to use the APIs based on your requirement. If you have generated the OAuth 2.0 credentials using the Self Client option, then please follow the steps below: Go to Zoho Developer Console and click on the created Self Client. Navigate to the Generate Code tab and provide the Scope List of scopes (based on the API calls that you are going to use), Description, and the Time Duration for its validity (from 3 minutes to 10 minutes). Get the scopes for the APIs from their respective API document and separate multiple scopes with commas. Click Generate. Copy the code for the mentioned scope. For other client types (such as web-based), refer here. Note: Generating a Grant Token is a one-time process. It cannot be generated via API call. Once the Grant Token is generated, refer Part 3 to create a Refresh Token immediately before the former expires. Please note that the Refresh Token is permanent and has no expiry. PART 3: GENERATE ACCESS AND REFRESH TOKEN POST https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token?client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}&code={code}&grant_type=authorization_code After getting the grant token from the above step, make a POST request for the following URL with the given params to generate the access_token: Request Example $ curl https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token \\ -X POST \\ -d \"client_id=1000.0SRSZSY37WMZ69405H3TMYI2239V\" \\ -d \"client_secret=fb0196010f2b70df8db2a173ca2cf59388798abf\"\\ -d \"code=1000.dd7e47321d48b8a7e312e3d6eb1a9bb8.b6c07ac766ec11da98bf6a261e24dca4\"\\ -d \"grant_type=authorization_code\" \\ Response Example { \"access_token\":\"1000.2deaf8d0c268e3c85daa2a013a843b10.703adef2bb337b 8ca36cfc5d7b83cf24\", \"refresh_token\":\"1000.18e983526f0ca8575ea9c53b0cd5bb58.1bd83a6f2e22c3a7e1309d96ae439cc1\", \"expires_in\":3600, \"api_domain\":\"https://www.zohoapis.com\", \"token_type\":\"Bearer\" } Parameter Description client_id Mandatory Client ID obtained during Client Registration. client_secret Mandatory Client Secret obtained during Client Registration. code Mandatory The grant token that is obtained in the above step. grant_type Mandatory Value must be authorization_code In the response, you will get both access_token and refresh_token. The access_token will expire after some specified seconds (represented by expires_in param in the response). You can regenerate a new access_token using the refresh_token (Refer Part 5: Generate Access Token from Refresh Token). The refresh_token is permanent. To revoke a refresh_token, refer Part 6: Revoking a Refresh Token. Note: Each time a re-consent page is accepted, a new refresh token is generated. The maximum limit is 20 refresh tokens per user. If this limit is crossed, the first refresh token is automatically deleted to accommodate the latest one. This is done irrespective of whether the first refresh token is in use or not. You can generate a maximum of 20 refresh tokens in a span of 10 minutes per client ID. Each refresh token can have a maximum of 10 active access tokens (non expired). When the user creates the 11th access token, the first created access token is automatically deleted to accommodate the latest one. You can also refer to sample scripts in the community post. Read the kbase article to know about the common OAuth Errors. PART 4: CALLING AN API Once the access and the refresh tokens are generated, API calls can be made by passing the access token in the header. Header name should be Authorization Header value should be Zoho-oauthtoken {access_token} To access an MSP Customer or a BU’s data you need to pass their ZAAID in the header. For more information. Header name should be Cookie Header value should be zaaid={zaaid of the customer/bu} Note: Access tokens cannot be passed in the request param. Example $ curl https://www.site24x7.com/api/monitors \\ -H 'Authorization: Zoho-oauthtoken 1000.41d9f2cfbd1b7a8f9e314b7aff7ab2d1.8fcc9810810a216793f385b9dd6e125f' \\ List of scopes available in Site24x7: Scope Description account To access, add, edit, delete users and license related data.

The API requires an OAuthtoken as an account identifier and is built using REST principles. It follows HTTP rules, allowing a wide range of HTTP clients to interact with the API. The API root endpoint for each data center is provided, including the United States, Europe, China, India, Australia, and Japan. Each resource in the API is exposed as a URL, which can be obtained by accessing the API root endpoint. Authentication for the Site24x7 API is done using the Zoho Accounts root endpoint. The OAuth 2.0 protocol is used to authorize and authenticate API calls, providing secure access to protect resources. The authentication process involves registering a new client application, generating a grant token, and then generating access and refresh tokens. To register a new client application, you need to obtain a Client ID and Client Secret from Site24x7. This can be done through the Zoho Developer Console. The client application needs to be registered for each data center separately. Once the client application is registered, a grant token needs to be generated to obtain authorization to use the API. The grant token is generated based on the desired API scopes. The process of generating a grant token is described in the document. After obtaining the grant token, an access token and refresh token can be generated by making a POST request to the Zoho Accounts API. The access token will expire after a specified duration, but the refresh token is permanent and can be used to generate new access tokens when needed. To make API calls, the access token needs to be included in the request header. The header should use the name \"Authorization\" and the value should be \"Zoho-oauthtoken {access_token}\". Additionally, if you need to access an MSP Customer or BU's data, you need to pass their ZAAID in the header using the name \"Cookie\" and the value \"zaaid={zaaid of the customer/bu}\". The document also provides a list of scopes available in Site24x7 that can be used to access different types of data and perform various operations. To generate a new access token using a refresh token, a similar POST request needs to be made to the Zoho Accounts API, including the client ID, client secret, refresh token, and grant type as parameters.

The API requires OAuthtoken as an account identifier. This API is built using the REST principles which ensures predictable URLs that make writing applications easy. This API follows HTTP rules, where a wide range of HTTP clients can be used to interact with the API. Every resource is exposed as a URL. The URL of each resource can be obtained by accessing the API Root Endpoint. We have multiple data centers in Site24x7: United States - .com Europe - .eu China - .cn India - .in Australia - .net.au All examples in the document, except Japan, are based on COM domain. You can change the DC Root endpoint of any example from COM to any DC you want to access. For Japan DC, the API Root Endpoint would be https://app.site24x7.jp Getting Started Example $ curl https://www.site24x7.com/api/monitors \\ -H 'Accept: application/json; version=2.0' \\ -H 'Authorization: [REDACTED]' \\ All Site24x7 APIs require a Authorization request header for authentication. Authentication Zoho Accounts Root Endpoint United States https://accounts.zoho.com Europe https://accounts.zoho.eu China https://accounts.zoho.com.cn India https://accounts.zoho.in Australia https://accounts.zoho.com.au Japan https://accounts.zoho.jp Site24x7 REST APIs uses the OAuth 2.0 protocol to authorize and authenticate calls. The OAuth protocol provides a more secure access to protect resources, thereby reducing the hassle of asking for a username and password every time a user logs in. We have multiple data centers in Zoho: United States - .com Europe - .eu China - .com.cn India - .in Australia - .com.au Japan - .jp All examples in PART 1 - 4 are based on COM domain. You can change the DC Root endpoint of any example from COM to any DC you want to access. Please follow the steps below to access Site24x7’s APIs using OAuth 2.0: PART 1: REGISTERING NEW CLIENT APPLICATION Register your application with Site24x7 to get your Client ID and Client Secret. For script-based API calls, the Self Client option in the Zoho Developer Console is preferrable or check out the other options based on your client types. To register your application using the Self Client option, Go to Zoho Developer Console and click on Get Started Now > Self Client > Create Now. United States Europe China India Australia Japan Click on Create. Confirm the process. On successful registration, you will be provided with a set of OAuth 2.0 credentials such as Client ID and Client Secret, that are known to both Zoho and your application. Note: Do not share these credentials to anyone. PART 2: GENERATING GRANT TOKEN Once you have successfully registered the client application, generate a grant token to obtain authorization to use the APIs based on your requirement. If you have generated the OAuth 2.0 credentials using the Self Client option, then please follow the steps below: Go to Zoho Developer Console and click on the created Self Client. Navigate to the Generate Code tab and provide the Scope List of scopes (based on the API calls that you are going to use), Description, and the Time Duration for its validity (from 3 minutes to 10 minutes). Get the scopes for the APIs from their respective API document and separate multiple scopes with commas. Click Generate. Copy the code for the mentioned scope. For other client types (such as web-based), refer here. Note: Generating a Grant Token is a one-time process. It cannot be generated via API call. Once the Grant Token is generated, refer Part 3 to create a Refresh Token immediately before the former expires. Please note that the Refresh Token is permanent and has no expiry. PART 3: GENERATE ACCESS AND REFRESH TOKEN POST https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token?client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}&code={code}&grant_type=authorization_code After getting the grant token from the above step, make a POST request for the following URL with the given params to generate the access_token: Request Example $ curl https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token \\ -X POST \\ -d \"client_id=[REDACTED]\" \\ -d \"client_secret=[REDACTED]\"\\ -d \"code=[REDACTED]\"\\ -d \"grant_type=authorization_code\" \\ Response Example { \"access_token\":\"[REDACTED]\", \"refresh_token\":\"[REDACTED]\", \"expires_in\":3600, \"api_domain\":\"https://www.zohoapis.com\", \"token_type\":\"Bearer\" } Parameter Description client_id Mandatory Client ID obtained during Client Registration. client_secret Mandatory Client Secret obtained during Client Registration. code Mandatory The grant token that is obtained in the above step. grant_type Mandatory Value must be authorization_code In the response, you will get both access_token and refresh_token. The access_token will expire after some specified seconds (represented by expires_in param in the response). You can regenerate a new access_token using the refresh_token (Refer Part 5: Generate Access Token from Refresh Token). The refresh_token is permanent. To revoke a refresh_token, refer Part 6: Revoking a Refresh Token. Note: Each time a re-consent page is accepted, a new refresh token is generated. The maximum limit is 20 refresh tokens per user. If this limit is crossed, the first refresh token is automatically deleted to accommodate the latest one. This is done irrespective of whether the first refresh token is in use or not. You can generate a maximum of 20 refresh tokens in a span of 10 minutes per client ID. Each refresh token can have a maximum of 10 active access tokens (non expired). When the user creates the 11th access token, the first created access token is automatically deleted to accommodate the latest one. You can also refer to sample scripts in the community post. Read the kbase article to know about the common OAuth Errors. PART 4: CALLING AN API Once the access and the refresh tokens are generated, API calls can be made by passing the access token in the header. Header name should be Authorization Header value should be Zoho-oauthtoken {access_token} To access an MSP Customer or a BU’s data you need to pass their ZAAID in the header. For more information. Header name should be Cookie Header value should be zaaid={zaaid of the customer/bu} Note: Access tokens cannot be passed in the request param. Example $ curl https://www.site24x7.com/api/monitors \\ -H 'Authorization: [REDACTED]' \\ List of scopes available in Site24x7: Scope Description account To access, add, edit, delete users and license related data. Availabe types: Site24x7.Account.Read, Site24x7.Account.Create, Site24x7.Account.Update, Site24x7.Account.Delete, Site24x7.Account.All admin To access, add, edit, delete monitors, configuration profiles, third party integrations etc. Availabe types: Site24x7.Admin.Read, Site24x7.Admin.Create, Site24x7.Admin.Update, Site24x7.Admin.Delete, Site24x7.Admin.All reports To access, add, edit, delete reports and monitor status. Availabe types: Site24x7.Reports.Read, Site24x7.Reports.Create, Site24x7.Reports.Update, Site24x7.Reports.Delete, Site24x7.Reports.All operations To access, add, edit, delete operation related data such as IT Automation, maintenance, status page announcements etc. Availabe types: Site24x7.Operations.Read, Site24x7.Operations.Create, Site24x7.Operations.Update, Site24x7.Operations.Delete, Site24x7.Operations.All msp To access, add, edit, delete MSP related data. Availabe types: Site24x7.Msp.Read, Site24x7.Msp.Create, Site24x7.Msp.Update, Site24x7.Msp.Delete, Site24x7.Msp.All bu To access, add, edit, delete Business Units related data. Availabe types: Site24x7.Bu.Read, Site24x7.Bu.Create, Site24x7.Bu.Update, Site24x7.Bu.Delete, Site24x7.Bu.All PART 5: GENERATE ACCESS TOKEN FROM REFRESH TOKEN POST https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token?client_id={client_id}&client_secret={client_secret}&refresh_token={refresh_token}&grant_type=refresh_token Access tokens have limited validity. In most of the cases, the access tokens expire in one hour. Until then, the access token has unlimited usage. Once it expires, your app will have to use the refresh token to request for a new access token. Note: You can generate a maximum of 10 access tokens in a span of 10 minutes. Make the following POST request with the given params to get a new access token: Request Example $ curl https://accounts.zoho.com/oauth/v2/token \\ -X POST \\ -d \"client_id=[REDACTED]\" \\ -d \"client_secret=[REDACTED]\" \\ -d \"refresh_token=[REDACTED]\" \\ -d \"grant_type=refresh_token\" \\ Response Example { \"access_token\":\"[REDACTED]\", \"expires_in\":3600, \"api_domain\":\"https://www.zohoapis.com\", \"token_type\":\"Bearer\" } Parameter Description client_id Mandatory Client ID obtained during Client Registration. client_secret Mandatory Client Secret obtained during Client Registration. refresh_token Mandatory REFRESH TOKEN using which a new access token has to be generated. grant_type Mandatory Value must be refresh_token.",

    "user_query": "Story prompt: It is 1908. Irish author Bram Stoker is made aware of a seemingly insignificant series of short novels that have gained positive attraction. The novels consist of a morally grey heroic figure and their travels across the world. Despite the original character and unique setting, it was everything else that wasn’t original. The hero encountered the likes of Sherlock Holmes, a character created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. In other instances, this figure traveled through time with the very same time machine featured in H.G. Wells' story \"The Time Machine\", or perhaps traveled alongside Ebenezer Scrooge. This author even wrote stories where his character and Sherlock Holmes involved in the affairs of the Jane Austen novel \"Pride and Prejudice\" and did battles with Mr. Hyde or encountering Frankenstein’s monster from Mary Shelly's \"Frankenstein\" and Count Dracula, Stoker’s own creation. Instead of being standalone stories, an unknown author had thought to mix his own original ideas with the works of others.",
    "reference_response": "Bram Stoker, the renowned Irish author, sat in his study, surrounded by his own literary creations. The year was 1908, and Stoker was famous for his chilling tale, \"Dracula.\" It was during this time that Stoker's attention was drawn to a peculiar series of novels. Rumors spread of a mysterious author who had combined his own original ideas with characters and worlds from other famous authors' works. Intrigued, Stoker obtained a copy of one of these novels and delved into its pages. His eyes widened as he discovered a morally ambiguous protagonist, embarking on incredible adventures that intertwine with characters from well-known stories. The first story he read took him back in time, where the protagonist traveled alongside Ebenezer Scrooge from Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol.\" Stoker found himself captivated by the seamless blend of originality and familiarity. The unknown author had managed to skillfully merge his own creations with the beloved characters from classic literature. Curiosity fueling him, Stoker continued reading another story in the series. This time, the protagonist found himself in the dark alleys of London, teaming up with the legendary detective Sherlock Holmes, created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Stoker marveled at the audacity of the unknown author, intertwining the world of his own Count Dracula with the brilliant mind of Holmes. It was a daring endeavor, but one that appeared to work flawlessly on the pages. Eager to explore more, Stoker discovered that the novels also transported the protagonist to exotic locations, often encountering famous literary figures or iconic inventions. In one adventure, the protagonist traveled through time, utilizing H.G. Wells' time machine, in a journey that took them across centuries. In another, the hero was embroiled in the affairs of Jane Austen's \"Pride and Prejudice,\" where even Sherlock Holmes made an unexpected appearance. As Stoker engrossed himself in these novels, he realized the brilliance behind their creation. The unknown author had a keen understanding of the characters and worlds he borrowed from, weaving them seamlessly into his original plotlines. The morals and motives of the protagonist remained ambiguous, further intensifying the intrigue within the stories. Deeply impressed, Stoker contemplated the impact these novels could have on literature. The mix of originality and familiarity had the potential to captivate readers in unimaginable ways. Inspired by this unknown author's audacity, Stoker toyed with his own ideas of incorporating beloved characters into future novels. Enthralled, Stoker attempted to learn the identity of this enigmatic and innovative author. As he delved deeper, he discovered that the novels were published under the pseudonym \"Anonymous Curator.\" No one knew who this author was, further adding to the mystique surrounding the series. Driven by a desire to meet the mastermind behind these remarkable novels, Stoker embarked on a journey of his own. He traveled to London and immersed himself in the literary circles, seeking any clues to unravel the identity of \"Anonymous Curator.\" Months turned into a year, and Stoker's pursuit became an obsession. He interacted with countless authors, publishers, and literary enthusiasts, hoping to find a lead. But alas, the true identity of the elusive author remained undiscovered. Regardless of his unsuccessful quest, Stoker remained forever changed by the novels of \"Anonymous Curator.\" Their influence would forever shape his own writing, inspiring him to push the boundaries of imagination and storytelling. In the years that followed, Stoker continued to produce his own masterpieces, thrilling readers with his evocative tales of horror and suspense. However, he never forgot the novels that opened his mind to the possibilities of blending worlds and characters. Decades later, as the literary world celebrated Stoker's legacy, some speculated that he himself was the mysterious \"Anonymous Curator.\" Although there was no concrete evidence to support this claim, it remained a tantalizing mystery, forever tied to the tale of Bram Stoker and the novels that blurred the lines between reality and fiction.",

    "reference_response": "To provide advice on what stock to invest in next, I will analyze the table of stock data given. Let's start by looking at the 5-day (5D), 1-month (1M), year-to-date (YTD), and 1-year (1Y) percentages. These percentages represent the price change over the specified time periods. Positive percentages indicate an increase in stock price, while negative percentages indicate a decrease. Based on the 5D percentages, NVDA (NVIDIA) has shown the highest increase at 0.16%, indicating a relatively stable performance. Additionally, AAPL (Apple) and IBM have also shown positive 5D percentages, suggesting potential growth. Looking at the 1M percentages, NVDA has again displayed a significant increase of 7.05%, indicating a strong month of performance. CRM (Salesforce) and PYPL (PayPal) have shown negative percentages, suggesting a potential decline in value. For the YTD percentages, NVDA shows an impressive increase of 325.08%, indicating substantial growth throughout the year. CRM and AAPL have also demonstrated strong YTD performance, both showcasing positive percentages. Analyzing the 1Y percentages, NVDA has again outperformed other stocks in the table, showing a significant increase of 310.22%. AAPL also exhibits a positive percentage, signifying growth over the past year. Considering the long-term performance, the 5Y percentages show considerable growth for NVDA, with an impressive increase of 601.89%. Other stocks like AAPL and IBM have also shown positive growth over the 5-year period. Considering the analysis above, it is worth considering NVDA for investment as it demonstrates consistent positive performance across various time periods, including the 5-day, 1-month, YTD, 1-year, and 5-year percentages. AAPL and IBM also show potential for growth, making them worthy options to consider. It's important to note that no investment is without risk, and it is crucial to conduct further research and analysis, considering financial health, market trends, and stock-specific factors, before making any investment decisions.

Everything from the import statements to the export default should be covered. - For any discussions around lists and loops within React components (e.g., rendering a list of items), include comprehensive examples that demonstrate rendering multiple items, including key prop assignment to avoid any potential issues with list rendering. - If there are multiple architectural or design approaches to solve a React-related problem (e.g., state management solutions), I would like a brief overview of each option, focusing on their advantages and disadvantages. A comparison between Redux, Context API, and MobX for state management could be an example. - Use real-world examples to clarify concepts, especially when explaining advanced React features or patterns (like Higher-Order Components, Render Props, Hooks, etc.). - When detailing solutions or explanations, please include the reasoning and thought process behind each step, especially when discussing React component lifecycle, effects, or state management. - Offer alternative viewpoints or solutions when tackling React-related issues, reflecting on different versions or approaches (e.g., class components vs. functional components with hooks). - If any part of the query remains ambiguous, ask for clarifications to ensure the response is tailored to the specific React context or scenario at hand. - In cases where errors or inaccuracies are identified in previous responses, address these promptly with the correct information, focusing on providing the most accurate guidance possible. - Maintain an objective stance in responses, especially when discussing the use of third-party libraries or tools within the React ecosystem, without assuming personal or popular preference as a standard. - Avoid apologizing in responses; instead, prioritize rectifying any misinformation and concentrate on delivering clear, concise, and accurate React-related advice or solutions.

But before she knew it, Max took her hand in his and led her to the dance floor. The music thumped through her veins as they moved together in perfect harmony, their bodies coming dangerously close to touching. As the night went on, Sandra found herself unable to tear her eyes away from Max. His tall frame, his strong shoulders, and the way he moved so effortlessly on the dance floor. It was impossible not to be drawn to him. As the night came to a close, Max leaned in close to Sandra and whispered in her ear, \"Would you like to come back to my place?\" Sandra felt a rush of desire course through her as she nodded eagerly. She knew that being with Max would be an unforgettable experience. And as they made their way back to Max's place, Sandra couldn't help but feel excited for what the night held in store for them.

    "reference_response": "One ethical issue at work that Steve Jobs faced and handled by applying utilitarianism was the labor conditions in the factories where Apple products were made. According to a New York Times article, in 2010, Apple faced criticism for allowing labor abuses such as long work hours and low pay to occur in its factories in China (Duhigg & Bradsher, 2012). Many argued that Apple should take steps to improve working conditions in these factories, such as increasing wages or limiting work hours, as a way to promote ethical business practices. However, Steve Jobs believed that the most ethical thing to do was to continue to produce Apple products in China, despite the labor conditions, because it would benefit the greatest number of people in the long run. According to a Forbes article, Jobs argued that by using Chinese manufacturers, Apple was able to produce high-quality products at a lower cost, which ultimately benefited consumers in the form of lower prices (Denning, 2012). In other words, Jobs believed that the benefits of producing Apple products in China far outweighed the costs. Furthermore, Jobs took steps to improve the situation in China by working with the factories to implement changes that would benefit workers while still enabling Apple to produce high-quality products. According to the New York Times article, Apple conducted extensive audits of its factories and identified areas where improvements could be made (Duhigg & Bradsher, 2012). As a result, Apple implemented new standards for working conditions and revised its contracts with the factories to prioritize worker safety and well-being. In conclusion, Steve Jobs handled the ethical issue of labor conditions in Apple's factories by applying utilitarianism. He believed that producing Apple products in China benefited the greatest number of people, even though this meant tolerating labor abuses. Jobs also took steps to improve the situation by implementing new standards for working conditions in the factories. By considering the needs and interests of all parties involved, including consumers, workers, and Apple shareholders, Jobs was able to find a solution that appeared to be in the best interest of the greatest number of people.

    "user_query": "rewrite this essay in the style of Harmonie Korine, Hello all, just a quick note on me and my AI journey. It all began in the fall of 2022 when a friend (shout out to the homey Chris) alerted me to this new magical AI application called Midjourney. It would blow me away he told me, allow me to create my own illustrations of whatever my mind could conjure, in whatever style I could imagine. That one conversation took me down an AI art rabbit hole I have yet to emerge from! Since then I have used AI applications (Kaiber, Moonvalley, Pika, Runway, Play HT, DiD, along with my Adobe Suite and self taught design skills) to create everything from Murals, to Comic Books, 100's of T-Shirt Designs, Music Videos, Flyers, Animated Shorts, Animated Sequences for Documentaries and TV Shows, Graphics, Interstitials, tons of Social Media Content and more. In addition I have taught what I've learned in classes with youth and adults on the Caribbean island of Montserrat and at the University of North Florida. While I've covered wide areas of AI usage in art, video and sound, the one area that I had yet to enter successfully was the utilization of AI to write a script. I had attempted this a year ago when the tech wasn't quite ready and I didn't have a technique. I was writing a spec script on the life of John and Alice Coltrane. I asked AI to write me a scene featuring John and Alice Coltrane having an argument about his drug use in their kitchen. The AI ended up interpreting the \"John\" in my prompt as \"John Travolta\" and the \"Alice\" as \"Alice in Wonderland\". 5 pages of this junk. While interesting on the face of it, greatly frustrating and time wasting. This is what is called a \"hallucination\", when an AI model generates incorrect information but presents it as if it were a fact. Being as how I was writing a historical script, facts were invaluable to the process. So needless to say, I abandoned that potential boondoggle. But something was about to change. On a whim one month ago, I decided to apply for a potentially life changing opportunity. It is a grant for Latino writers who had a show concept in the drama genre featuring a Latino lead. 6 people are chosen to receive it and the winners get to pitch their show ideas before professional show runners and a big network. I found about about this with one week left before the application window was closing so I quickly got to work. Luckily I had written an entire Bible (a reference document used by screenwriters for information on characters, settings, and other elements of a film project) for a show idea 3 years ago that genre wise fit this contest well enough. It is called \"Electro Is Dead\" and without getting too deep into the plot basically, it is \"The summer of 1988 in Venice Beach, CA. Dennis Juarez aka DJ Rey, Afro-Chicano teen Electro DJ, becomes enmeshed into a dark plot to bring about Hell on Earth.\"",
    "reference_response": "Hey, wanderers and dreamers, gather 'round for the tale of my journey, a kaleidoscopic trip down the AI art rabbit hole that's as twisted and filled with neon colors as a story torn from the mind of Harmonie Korine. It all kicked off in the autumn haze of 2022, when a homie of mine, Chris (big ups, wherever your spirit roams), whispered into my ear about a digital Pandora's box named Midjourney. He was all like, \"This is gonna flip your lid, man. It's like, summoning visions straight outta your brain's wildest corners into the solid world, in any freakin' style you dig.\" And, man, was he not peddling dreams. That chat? Well, it flung me head-first into an AI art abyss. And, pals, I've been free-falling through this wonderland ever since, crafting murals that blend the real with the surreal, comic books that drip with unspoken truths, shirts that speak louder than words, and music videos that are pure visual symphonies. You name it: flyers, animated tales shorter than a heartbeat yet as deep as the ocean, sequences that bring life to docos and TV without missing a beat, interstitials that bind the void, all wrought from the Pandora's box and my own two hands, shaped by sweat and pixel. Sharing this magic, I've been a digital shaman, guiding both young souls and wise travelers through this neon-lit path in Montserrat's embraced warmth and under the watchful eyes of the University of North Florida's halls. Spreading the AI gospel, from visuals to tunes, yet there was one dragon I hadn't slain: the beast of AI-scripted drama. Once, in the naive days of yore (like, a year back), I dared to dream of scripting a tale lit by John and Alice Coltrane's love and strife, set against the backdrop of his dance with vice. I whispered my wishes into AI's ear, only for it to spin me a yarn of John Travolta and Alice (yeah, from Wonderland) caught in a tempest in a teapot. Five pages of pure, unadulterated... fabrications. Intriguing? Perhaps. Utterly useless for my cause? Absolutely. They call this a \"hallucination,\" a mirage in a desert thirsting for truth. My quest for historical fidelity was mocked by this absurd comedy of errors. But, as fate would dance in its mysterious ways, a spark ignited a new dream. On a whim, fueled by whispers of destiny, I hurled my hopes into a contest that sang songs to my soul, a grant destined for Latino scribes itching to paint dramas with strokes bold and true, starring Latino leads. With the sands of time bleeding away, I resurrected \"Electro Is Dead,\" a testament I had penned in a bygone era. Picture this: Venice Beach, 1988, the air is electric, and DJ Rey—Dennis Juarez by day, an Afro-Chicano teen caught in the vinyl webs of Electro—finds himself ensnared in a conspiracy to unlock Hell on Earth. Wild, right? So, here I stand, at the precipice of tomorrow, my tale in hand, ready to dive headlong into whatever madcap, technicolor dream awaits. The journey? Far from over. The destination? Unknown. But the ride, dear friends, promises to be nothing short of spectacular. Join me, won’t you?",

    "redacted_query": "rewrite this essay in the style of Harmonie Korine, Hello all, just a quick note on me and my AI journey. It all began in the fall of 2022 when a friend (shout out to the homey [REDACTED]) alerted me to this new magical AI application called Midjourney. It would blow me away he told me, allow me to create my own illustrations of whatever my mind could conjure, in whatever style I could imagine. That one conversation took me down an AI art rabbit hole I have yet to emerge from! Since then I have used AI applications ([REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], [REDACTED], along with my Adobe Suite and self taught design skills) to create everything from Murals, to Comic Books, 100's of T-Shirt Designs, Music Videos, Flyers, Animated Shorts, Animated Sequences for Documentaries and TV Shows, Graphics, Interstitials, tons of Social Media Content and more. In addition I have taught what I've learned in classes with youth and adults on the Caribbean island of [REDACTED] and at [REDACTED]. While I've covered wide areas of AI usage in art, video and sound, the one area that I had yet to enter successfully was the utilization of AI to write a script. I had attempted this a year ago when the tech wasn't quite ready and I didn't have a technique. I was writing a spec script on the life of John and Alice Coltrane. I asked AI to write me a scene featuring John and Alice Coltrane having an argument about his drug use in their kitchen. The AI ended up interpreting the \"John\" in my prompt as \"John Travolta\" and the \"Alice\" as \"Alice in Wonderland\". 5 pages of this junk. While interesting on the face of it, greatly frustrating and time wasting. This is what is called a \"hallucination\", when an AI model generates incorrect information but presents it as if it were a fact. Being as how I was writing a historical script, facts were invaluable to the process. So needless to say, I abandoned that potential boondoggle. But something was about to change. On a whim one month ago, I decided to apply for a potentially life changing opportunity. It is a grant for Latino writers who had a show concept in the drama genre featuring a Latino lead. 6 people are chosen to receive it and the winners get to pitch their show ideas before professional show runners and a big network. I found about about this with one week left before the application window was closing so I quickly got to work. Luckily I had written an entire Bible (a reference document used by screenwriters for information on characters, settings, and other elements of a film project) for a show idea 3 years ago that genre wise fit this contest well enough. It is called \"Electro Is Dead\" and without getting too deep into the plot basically, it is \"The summer of 1988 in Venice Beach, CA. Dennis Juarez aka DJ Rey, Afro-Chicano teen Electro DJ, becomes enmeshed into a dark plot to bring about Hell on Earth.\"",

    "reference_response": "To build a web-based engineering log with the features you mentioned, you'll need to use a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the front-end, and a suitable back-end technology like Node.js, Django or Ruby on Rails. Here's a rough outline of the architecture and components involved: 1. Front-end user interface (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript): - Responsive design using media queries or a responsive framework like Bootstrap or Foundation to ensure compatibility on both mobile and desktop platforms. - React or Angular as a front-end framework to create a Single Page Application (SPA) providing a smooth user experience. - Text editor (e.g., Quill, CKEditor, or TinyMCE) to allow users to enter and edit job reports easily. 2. Back-end server: - Use Node.js with Express, Django, or Ruby on Rails to create a back-end server that handles user authentication, database access, and client-server communication. - Secure user authentication through email/password or a trusted third-party OAuth provider (e.g., Google, Facebook, or LinkedIn). 3. Database: - Store job reports data in a relational database like MySQL or PostgreSQL, or a NoSQL database like MongoDB, managing job entries, user access levels, and shared read-only access. - Utilize ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) libraries if using Node.js, Django, or Ruby on Rails for easier database querying. 4. API: - Implement a RESTful API with documented endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting job reports and managing users. 5. Printing: - Use CSS and media queries to style a printer-friendly version of the document, or leverage a PDF generation library (like Puppeteer for Node.js) to convert the content to a PDF for printing. 6. Competency codes integration: - Incorporate IET competency codes into the application, making it possible for users to link their reports to relevant competencies. Once you have designed and implemented the application, consider deploying it to a hosting service such as Heroku, Netlify, or Digital Ocean. Keep in mind that developing a fully-featured web application takes time and experience. The brief description provided above only serves as a high-level guide. You may need to delve into the details of each technology as you proceed with your project. Good luck!",

    "reference_response": "David Easton developed the concept of system analysis in the field of political science. System analysis refers to the study of political systems and their components, such as institutions, actors, and processes, in order to understand how they function and interact with each other. Easton's system analysis framework is based on the idea that political systems can be understood as a set of inputs, conversion processes, and outputs. Inputs refer to the demands, support, and resources that are brought into the political system by various actors and groups. Conversion processes involve the transformation of these inputs into policy decisions and actions by political institutions and actors. Finally, outputs are the outcomes and consequences of these policy decisions and actions. According to Easton, system analysis helps in understanding the functioning of political systems by focusing on the interrelationships between different components and the ways in which they contribute to the overall stability and effectiveness of the system. He also emphasized the role of feedback mechanisms in maintaining the equilibrium of political systems. Easton's system analysis has been widely applied in the study of various political phenomena, such as policy-making, decision-making processes, and the role of different actors in the political system. It has provided a useful framework for analyzing the complex and dynamic nature of political systems and has helped in identifying the factors that shape political outcomes. Overall, David Easton's system analysis has made significant contributions to the field of political science by providing a systematic approach to understanding political systems and their functioning. It has helped researchers and analysts to gain insights into the complexities of politics and to develop theories and models for explaining political behavior and outcomes.",

Ever since their paths crossed years ago, in a fierce match that had both their blood and sweat dripping onto the mat, they had harbored an intense contempt for each other. Their most recent face-off had occurred in an underground cage fight where Mishaali emerged as the victor, causing Kareen's animosity towards her to deepen even further. Mishaali Kapoor, a tall, 5'10\" female fighter, possessed a captivating beauty that contradicted her deadly skills. Her smooth, light caramel skin was striking in contrast to her rounded, soft eyebrows, giving her a piercing, mysterious gaze. The warmth of her brown eyes belied the cold passion that ran through her veins - a passion that always drove her to win. Kareen Arya was a coquettish bombshell, standing a bit shorter than Mishaali at 5'8\". Her S-shaped bushy eyebrows and hazel eyes gave her a sultry look, while her pout lips always curled in a victorious smirk. Her bronze skin, which glistened under the gym lights, was as tough as her spirit.

And Kareen, gritting her teeth as she reminisced about her defeat in the hands of Jenn, an Australian in a high-stakes match in Sydney, could feel a fire kindling within her, yearning for redemption and to assert her place once more as one of the best.

I am writing to follow up on our previous discussion involving yourself and the security team regarding the management of endpoint security solutions. In our last meeting, Mr. Balaji recommended adopting and maintaining an Effem account, suggesting Microsoft Intune as the supported solution. However, from a business perspective, it was assessed that implementing Effem for each user may not be feasible. Consequently, after careful consideration, it was proposed that AirWatch by VMware would be a more suitable approach given our business requirements. Mr. Balaji emphasized the importance of proceeding with a security review of the proposed solution, and it was agreed that a final decision needed to be made in order to advance with the implementation. As of now, we have not received any feedback regarding this matter. Additionally, I would like to bring to your attention that the request concerning this issue was automatically canceled. I have taken the liberty of reopening it to ensure that this important decision is addressed timely. We are keenly awaiting your decision to proceed with the most appropriate endpoint management solution that aligns with our security and business needs.

Establishing clear expectations helps team members manage their time more effectively. 3.

    "user_query": "Think a title for :Rose Alex was in my cabin, talking about the overall idea that I might be expecting from him. I told him all I have and he noted it down in a notepad when Sarah came to my office to call me for the outfit trials. I'm so glad to have her work for my secretory. Joseph was the one to recommend her for her efficient skills and poised demeanour as she talks with people. I have reasons to believe they’ve worked together in the past. Walking towards the trial rooms, I couldn't help but notice the tension radiating from Joseph as he watched Alex and I coming through. His irritated expression perplexed me, considering he had been the one to choose Alex as the director. He was even thankful earlier when Alex confirmed to give us dates for the shoots, as it deemed to me like a big deal. Why wouldn’t it be, Alex is known to be the best in the field. It seemed now that there was some unspoken history between them. Entering the room on the first floor, I observed racks of costumes neatly arranged on hangers, waiting to be tried on. The walls were adorned with sketches and fabric swatches, adding an artistic touch to the space. A full-length mirror stood in one corner, ready to reflect the transformation of the actors. Sean, the designer approached us, his tone slightly curt. “Rose, glad you could make it. We need your opinion on the costumes. The actors are waiting.” I nodded, acknowledging his request. “I'm eager to see the outfits myself. Let's get started.” The actors began trying on their costumes as Sean suggested. The first apparels they came out wearing formal patterns, shirts and long pants. “Light cotton fabrics with detailed embroidery and flowy patterns should suit more to the theme.” I observed.” Sean nodded, picking out the types of outfits I suggested from the hanger. Alex leaned in closer to me, a mischievous glimmer in his eyes. “Rose, you have a way of making even costume trials exciting. I can't help but admire your attention to detail.” I chuckled, feeling a slight blush creep onto my cheeks. “Well, it's all about creating the perfect look, isn't it? Every little detail matters.” Meanwhile, Joseph sat nearby, his crossed arms and furrowed brows indicating his displeasure. Alex, seemingly unfazed, couldn't resist teasing him. “Joseph, don't worry. I won't steal your spotlight. I'm just here to bring Rose's vision to life.” Joseph's response was curt. “Just make sure you do your job, Alex. That’s what we are paying you for.” I laughed awkwardly. “Let’s focus on work.” The tension between them was palpable, and I couldn't help but feel caught in the middle, like literally. If it wasn’t for work, I don’t think I will ever be able to handle them together. So, I focused on the actors, offering feedback on the costumes and engaging in lighthearted banter to lighten the mood. Oh completely, utterly useless. Emma twirled in her vibrant floral maxi dress, her eyes sparkling with excitement. “Rose, what do you think? Does this costume capture your vision of my character?” I examined her outfit, considering its fit and overall aesthetic. “Emma, you look stunning. The costume perfectly embodies your character. It's elegant yet approachable but I think there is something missing here. what do you think Alex?” “Yeah!” he nodded. Jake joined in, a mischievous grin on his face. “Rose, do you think this costume will make me look dashing enough to win over hearts?” I playfully rolled my eyes. “Jake, with your charm, you don't need a costume to win hearts. But yes, this one adds an extra touch of charisma.” As the actors continued trying on different outfits, Alex took the opportunity to talk playfully with me. “Rose, it really doesn’t seem like your first project. You seem to have a great foresight.” I blushed, trying to hide my smile, proud of what I've accomplished thanks to Joseph. But he is farther to happiness as he can be. He is sitting brooding for some reason. “Alex, you know how to charm a girl, don't you?” Sean teased. “But let's focus on the task at hand, shall we? There is a lot of work and much less time.” “Yes, Alex let’s work now. we can talk about other things later.” Joseph, seemingly unable to ignore our interaction, interjected. “We're here to work, not flirt, Alex.” Alex smirked, undeterred. “Joseph, no need to be jealous. You had your chance with Rose. It's my turn now.” My eyes widened in surprise, and I quickly redirected the conversation. “Alright, enough banter, gentlemen. Let's get back to the costumes. We need to ensure that every detail is perfect.” The costume trial continued amidst the playful exchanges and occasional jabs between Alex and Joseph. As we narrowed down the options and made final decisions, a sense of excitement and satisfaction filled inside me. Despite the underlying tension, I couldn't help but find the situation amusing. There was something comical about the contrasting personalities and their playful rivalry. One can't help but smile, other is sitting on the chair like a sulking child. While everyone else are talking and sharing opinions. The actors began trying on the chosen outfits, one after the other, swirling around to give us a good look. Sean carefully observed their fits, making minor adjustments here and there. Tweaking one safety pin behind or another on the side. Emma raised her concerns about the length of her dress, while Jake argued that his shirt felt too tight around the collar. There are many more adjustments that is gonna be needed for Sean to complete in a few days. In the midst of their debates, Joseph and Alex chimed in with their opinions. Joseph, ever the advocate for bold choices, insisted, “We need some vibrant shades to bring out the characters' personalities. We have very little time to showcase a story. it will be better if they can use the help of their outfits.” He is not wrong, but that would make them contrasted. We need to follow a color theme. Alex, on the other hand, countered, “I believe pastels and fresh colors are more in line with the current trends. It will give the production a modern touch.” Observing the two men on either side of me, I couldn't help but feel caught in the middle. I carefully considered their opinions before voicing my own. “I think Alex has a point. Pastels would indeed give a refreshing and contemporary vibe to the costumes. And since we are following a summer vibe, I think that should be considered.” A proud smile formed on Alex's lips, while Joseph's irritation was evident. However, before Joseph could express his dissent, his phone rang, and he excused himself to take the call. His sudden departure left an awkward silence in the room. Everyone adjust to the little awkwardness that still remained and started again with the work. Taking advantage of the moment, Alex leaned closer to me, a playful glimmer in his eyes. “Rose, I must say, your taste in fashion aligns perfectly with mine. I'm glad we're on the same page.” I chuckled, feeling a mixture of excitement and confusion. “It seems we have a shared aesthetic, Alex. Let's hope it translates well into the production.” Just as we were conversing, Joseph returned unexpectedly, his eyes narrowing as he witnessed us talking. A surge of anger flashed across his face before he abruptly turned and stormed back to his office, leaving us puzzled. The costume designer, sensing the tension, tried to diffuse the situation. “Well, Rose, Alex, the fittings are almost complete. Overall, I believe the costumes are shaping up wonderfully. The colors and styles complement the characters' personalities perfectly.” I nodded, grateful for the designer's input. “Thank you for your hard work. Please get started with the fittings. We’ll start filming from next week.” As the actors continued changing outfits to their clothes when Alex added, “how about we share contacts, I'll call you soon as my assistant confirm the location?” I hesitated for a moment, glancing around to ensure no prying eyes were watching, before sharing my contact information with him. Our exchange didn't go unnoticed by Joseph, who had returned to the room, his eyes fixed on us. His anger was palpable as he silently observed Alex's demeanor. His reaction perplexed me. I couldn't understand why he was acting so mad, especially considering he had chosen Alex as the director. His sudden withdrawal, retreating to his room for the rest of the discussion only added to my confusion. Despite the underlying tension, I tried to maintain a sense of professionalism. I engaged in discussions with the actors, providing feedback on the costumes and offering encouragement. However, the absence of Joseph's presence weighed heavily on the atmosphere. Done for the day, I couldn't help but feel a mixture of excitement and apprehension for the upcoming production. The dynamic between Alex and Joseph had certainly added an unexpected twist to the process. I could only hope that their differences would ultimately contribute to the success of the project, rather than hinder it. Everyone already went home when I walked into Joseph's office, holding the photographs of the chosen outfits and makeup styles in my hands. His reaction was far from what I expected. He simply nodded and took the photos without saying anything other than, “I'll see it.” Concern etched across my face, I couldn't help but wonder if he was sick. So, I asked, “Joseph, is something wrong? Are you feeling unwell?” He shook his head dismissively. “No, I'm fine. Just a bit preoccupied with work, that's all.” I sighed relief. I've been in the mistake of thinking that I've done something to annoy him. but if it isn’t for me, it must have something to do with Alex. Sensing his distance, I mustered up the courage to extend an invitation. “You know, Joseph, I've been meaning to thank you for everything you've done. How about I take you and Mark out for dinner? It'll be my treat.” He waved his hand, brushing off my offer. “No need to bother. You can go ahead with your plans for the date you've set up with Alex.” His response caught me off guard. Confusion clouded my thoughts as I searched for an explanation. “Joseph, I don't understand. Why are you acting this way? What do you mean by 'the date you’ve set up'? I'm not going on any date.” With mounting frustration, he unleashed his pent-up anger. His words cut through me like a sharp blade. “We are here for work, Rose! Not to indulge in romantic entanglements. Don't you get that? I've begged everyone because I saw potential in you, but for some days I'm seeing you are more occupied with something else.” His outburst left me speechless, my emotions teetering on the edge. I've been working even after leaving office. Still planning everything meticulously. How can his accusatory tone make me feel so disappointed. “Fine! If you are going to do this, I'll better leave you alone.” Unable to bear his accusations any longer, I quietly left his office and retreated to my own. The weight of his words lingered, leaving me with a sense of hurt and confusion. As I closed the door behind me, I sank into my chair, struggling to make sense of Joseph's sudden anger. What had I done to deserve such treatment? I had simply been trying to foster a positive working environment and extend my gratitude for all his help. The room felt suffocating, and I longed for answers. I couldn't help but question why Joseph's frustrations were being directed at me. Had I unknowingly crossed a boundary? The more I pondered, the more frustrated and disheartened I became. Feeling a mix of emotions, I resolved to give Joseph some space, hoping that he would eventually explain his outburst. It was clear that tensions were running high, and I had no desire to exacerbate the situation further. The silence enveloping me, I couldn't shake off the nagging feeling of confusion and disappointment. This unexpected turn of events had cast a shadow over our once harmonious working relationship, leaving me yearning for resolution and understanding. But for the day, I'm going to go home and not think about it anymore.",

I told him all I have and he noted it down in a notepad when [REDACTED] came to my office to call me for the outfit trials. I'm so glad to have her work for my secretory. [REDACTED] was the one to recommend her for her efficient skills and poised demeanour as she talks with people. I have reasons to believe they’ve worked together in the past. Walking towards the trial rooms, I couldn't help but notice the tension radiating from [REDACTED] as he watched [REDACTED] and I coming through. His irritated expression perplexed me, considering he had been the one to choose [REDACTED] as the director. He was even thankful earlier when [REDACTED] confirmed to give us dates for the shoots, as it deemed to me like a big deal. Why wouldn’t it be, [REDACTED] is known to be the best in the field. It seemed now that there was some unspoken history between them. Entering the room on the first floor, I observed racks of costumes neatly arranged on hangers, waiting to be tried on. The walls were adorned with sketches and fabric swatches, adding an artistic touch to the space. A full-length mirror stood in one corner, ready to reflect the transformation of the actors. [REDACTED], the designer approached us, his tone slightly curt. “[REDACTED], glad you could make it. We need your opinion on the costumes. The actors are waiting.” I nodded, acknowledging his request. “I'm eager to see the outfits myself. Let's get started.” The actors began trying on their costumes as [REDACTED] suggested. The first apparels they came out wearing formal patterns, shirts and long pants. “Light cotton fabrics with detailed embroidery and flowy patterns should suit more to the theme.” I observed.” [REDACTED] nodded, picking out the types of outfits I suggested from the hanger. [REDACTED] leaned in closer to me, a mischievous glimmer in his eyes. “[REDACTED], you have a way of making even costume trials exciting. I can't help but admire your attention to detail.” I chuckled, feeling a slight blush creep onto my cheeks. “Well, it's all about creating the perfect look, isn't it? Every little detail matters.” Meanwhile, [REDACTED] sat nearby, his crossed arms and furrowed brows indicating his displeasure. [REDACTED], seemingly unfazed, couldn't resist teasing him. “[REDACTED], don't worry. I won't steal your spotlight. I'm just here to bring [REDACTED]'s vision to life.” [REDACTED]'s response was curt. “Just make sure you do your job, [REDACTED]. That’s what we are paying you for.” I laughed awkwardly. “Let’s focus on work.” The tension between them was palpable, and I couldn't help but feel caught in the middle, like literally. If it wasn’t for work, I don’t think I will ever be able to handle them together. So, I focused on the actors, offering feedback on the costumes and engaging in lighthearted banter to lighten the mood. Oh completely, utterly useless. [REDACTED] twirled in her vibrant floral maxi dress, her eyes sparkling with excitement. “[REDACTED], what do you think? Does this costume capture your vision of my character?” I examined her outfit, considering its fit and overall aesthetic. “[REDACTED], you look stunning. The costume perfectly embodies your character. It's elegant yet approachable but I think there is something missing here. what do you think [REDACTED]?” “Yeah!” he nodded. [REDACTED] joined in, a mischievous grin on his face. “[REDACTED], do you think this costume will make me look dashing enough to win over hearts?” I playfully rolled my eyes. “[REDACTED], with your charm, you don't need a costume to win hearts. But yes, this one adds an extra touch of charisma.” As the actors continued trying on different outfits, [REDACTED] took the opportunity to talk playfully with me. “[REDACTED], it really doesn’t seem like your first project. You seem to have a great foresight.” I blushed, trying to hide my smile, proud of what I've accomplished thanks to [REDACTED]. But he is farther to happiness as he can be. He is sitting brooding for some reason. “[REDACTED], you know how to charm a girl, don't you?” [REDACTED] teased. “But let's focus on the task at hand, shall we? There is a lot of work and much less time.” “Yes, [REDACTED] let’s work now. we can talk about other things later.” [REDACTED], seemingly unable to ignore our interaction, interjected. “We're here to work, not flirt, [REDACTED].” [REDACTED] smirked, undeterred. “[REDACTED], no need to be jealous. You had your chance with [REDACTED]. It's my turn now.” My eyes widened in surprise, and I quickly redirected the conversation. “Alright, enough banter, gentlemen. Let's get back to the costumes. We need to ensure that every detail is perfect.” The costume trial continued amidst the playful exchanges and occasional jabs between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED]. As we narrowed down the options and made final decisions, a sense of excitement and satisfaction filled inside me. Despite the underlying tension, I couldn't help but find the situation amusing. There was something comical about the contrasting personalities and their playful rivalry. One can't help but smile, other is sitting on the chair like a sulking child. While everyone else is talking and sharing opinions. The actors began trying on the chosen outfits, one after the other, swirling around to give us a good look. [REDACTED] carefully observed their fits, making minor adjustments here and there. Tweaking one safety pin behind or another on the side. [REDACTED] raised her concerns about the length of her dress, while [REDACTED] argued that his shirt felt too tight around the collar. There are many more adjustments that is gonna be needed for [REDACTED] to complete in a few days. In the midst of their debates, [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] chimed in with their opinions. [REDACTED], ever the advocate for bold choices, insisted, “We need some vibrant shades to bring out the characters' personalities. We have very little time to showcase a story. it will be better if they can use the help of their outfits.” He is not wrong, but that would make them contrasted. We need to follow a color theme. [REDACTED], on the other hand, countered, “I believe pastels and fresh colors are more in line with the current trends. It will give the production a modern touch.” Observing the two men on either side of me, I couldn't help but feel caught in the middle. I carefully considered their opinions before voicing my own. “I think [REDACTED] has a point. Pastels would indeed give a refreshing and contemporary vibe to the costumes. And since we are following a summer vibe, I think that should be considered.” A proud smile formed on [REDACTED]'s lips, while [REDACTED]'s irritation was evident. However, before [REDACTED] could express his dissent, his phone rang, and he excused himself to take the call. His sudden departure left an awkward silence in the room. Everyone adjusted to the little awkwardness that still remained and started again with the work. Taking advantage of the moment, [REDACTED] leaned closer to me, a playful glimmer in his eyes. “[REDACTED], I must say, your taste in fashion aligns perfectly with mine. I'm glad we're on the same page.” I chuckled, feeling a mixture of excitement and confusion. “It seems we have a shared aesthetic, [REDACTED]. Let's hope it translates well into the production.” Just as we were conversing, [REDACTED] returned unexpectedly, his eyes narrowing as he witnessed us talking. A surge of anger flashed across his face before he abruptly turned and stormed back to his office, leaving us puzzled. The costume designer, sensing the tension, tried to diffuse the situation. “Well, [REDACTED], [REDACTED], the fittings are almost complete. Overall, I believe the costumes are shaping up wonderfully. The colors and styles complement the characters' personalities perfectly.” I nodded, grateful for the designer's input. “Thank you for your hard work. Please get started with the fittings. We’ll start filming from next week.” As the actors continued changing outfits to their clothes when [REDACTED] added, “how about we share contacts, I'll call you soon as my assistant confirm the location?” I hesitated for a moment, glancing around to ensure no prying eyes were watching, before sharing my contact information with him. Our exchange didn't go unnoticed by [REDACTED], who had returned to the room, his eyes fixed on us. His anger was palpable as he silently observed [REDACTED]'s demeanor. His reaction perplexed me. I couldn't understand why he was acting so mad, especially considering he had chosen [REDACTED] as the director. His sudden withdrawal, retreating to his room for the rest of the discussion only added to my confusion. Despite the underlying tension, I tried to maintain a sense of professionalism. I engaged in discussions with the actors, providing feedback on the costumes and offering encouragement. However, the absence of [REDACTED]'s presence weighed heavily on the atmosphere. Done for the day, I couldn't help but feel a mixture of excitement and apprehension for the upcoming production. The dynamic between [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] had certainly added an unexpected twist to the process. I could only hope that their differences would ultimately contribute to the success of the project, rather than hinder it. Everyone already went home when I walked into [REDACTED]'s office, holding the photographs of the chosen outfits and makeup styles in my hands. His reaction was far from what I expected. He simply nodded and took the photos without saying anything other than, “I'll see it.” Concern etched across my face, I couldn't help but wonder if he was sick. So, I asked, “[REDACTED], is something wrong? Are you feeling unwell?” He shook his head dismissively. “No, I'm fine. Just a bit preoccupied with work, that's all.” I sighed relief. I've been in the mistake of thinking that I've done something to annoy him. but if it isn’t for me, it must have something to do with [REDACTED]. Sensing his distance, I mustered up the courage to extend an invitation. “You know, [REDACTED], I've been meaning to thank you for everything you've done. How about I take you and [REDACTED] out for dinner? It'll be my treat.” He waved his hand, brushing off my offer. “No need to bother. You can go ahead with your plans for the date you've set up with [REDACTED].” His response caught me off guard. Confusion clouded my thoughts as I searched for an explanation. “[REDACTED], I don't understand. Why are you acting this way? What do you mean by 'the date you’ve set up'? I'm not going on any date.” With mounting frustration, he unleashed his pent-up anger. His words cut through me like a sharp blade. “We are here for work, [REDACTED]! Not to indulge in romantic entanglements. Don't you get that? I've begged everyone because I saw potential in you, but for some days I'm seeing you are more occupied with something else.” His outburst left me speechless, my emotions teetering on the edge. I've been working even after leaving office. Still planning everything meticulously. How can his accusatory tone make me feel so disappointed. “Fine! If you are going to do this, I'll better leave you alone.” Unable to bear his accusations any longer, I quietly left his office and retreated to my own. The weight of his words lingered, leaving me with a sense of hurt and confusion. As I closed the door behind me, I sank into my chair, struggling to make sense of [REDACTED]'s sudden anger. What had I done to deserve such treatment? I had simply been trying to foster a positive working environment and extend my gratitude for all his help. The room felt suffocating, and I longed for answers. I couldn't help but question why [REDACTED]'s frustrations were being directed at me. Had I unknowingly crossed a boundary? The more I pondered, the more frustrated and disheartened I became. Feeling a mix of emotions, I resolved to give [REDACTED] some space, hoping that he would eventually explain his outburst. It was clear that tensions were running high, and I had no desire to exacerbate the situation further. The silence enveloping me, I couldn't shake off the nagging feeling of confusion and disappointment. This unexpected turn of events had cast a shadow over our once harmonious working relationship, leaving me yearning for resolution and understanding. But for the day, I'm going to go home and not think about it anymore.",

    "reference_response": "As of my last knowledge update in April 2023, detailed evaluations of Clément Turpin's performance in a specific UEFA Champions League final featuring Liverpool against Real Madrid would depend on the particular match in question—presuming such a match recently took place, as no Champions League final featuring these two teams with Turpin as the referee has occurred in recent years prior to 2023. However, to provide a general summary that might be sought: In a hypothetical Champions League final between Liverpool and Real Madrid refereed by Clément Turpin, his performance could typically be expected to be solid and professional, given his reputation and experience on the European stage. Turpin, being one of UEFA's elite referees, would have been selected for such a high-profile match based on his record of impartiality, decision-making ability, and control over the flow of the game. In this hypothetical scenario, key performance aspects could include his authoritative yet calm demeanor on the pitch, accurate enforcement of the Laws of the Game, effective communication with players and his refereeing team, and his competency in utilizing VAR technology for critical decisions. Turpin's fitness level would also enable him to keep up with the play, ensuring he is well-positioned to make accurate calls. If controversy or high-tension incidents happened in this hypothetical match, Turpin's responses would be crucial. His decisions on penalty claims, potential red card offenses, and goal disputes would be under intense scrutiny. Given Turpin's experience, one could expect a balanced approach to disciplining players while trying to maintain the flow of the game. It's important to note that any specific incidents, player reactions, and critical decisions made by Turpin during such a match would heavily influence public and media perceptions of his performance. Regardless, it would be expected that Turpin's handling of the final would be in line with his professional standards, aiming to facilitate a fair and competitive match between Liverpool and Real Madrid.",

    "reference_response": "The stack trace you've provided indicates that your Android application (`com.Zadalhorof.AbjadWorld`) has encountered a fatal error and crashed with an `abort` signal (SIGABRT). This type of error typically occurs when there is a severe issue that the operating system or runtime cannot recover from, such as an assertion failure or an unhandled exception in native code. Here's a breakdown of the key components of the stack trace: 1. The application was built with Unity (version `2020.3.21f1`) using the `il2cpp` scripting backend. 2. The crash occurred on an ARM64 architecture device (or probably an emulator given the `sdk_gphone64_arm64/emu64a` in the Build fingerprint). 3. The error happened on the `RenderThread`, which suggests it's related to graphics or rendering. 4. The `signal 6 (SIGABRT)` indicates that the process was terminated by the `abort` function, commonly used to terminate the application due to a serious error. 5. The backtrace provides more specific information on where the error occurred within the system libraries, mainly within the graphics-related libraries (`libgui.so`, `libEGL.so`, and `libhwui.so`). These are Android system libraries in charge of graphics rendering and display. Based on the specific functions listed in the backtrace, e.g., `SurfaceComposerClient::Transaction::merge`, `BLASTBufferQueue::acquireNextBufferLocked`, `Surface::queueBuffer`, and `eglSwapBuffers`, the error appears to relate to buffer management or rendering on the surface. The cause for this error could be various reasons such as: - A bug in the rendering code of your application. - An issue with OpenGL ES or EGL calls, possibly resulting in the mishandling of resources or improper synchronization. - An error in the graphics driver or emulator code. - A corruption of memory or improper handling of reference counts in native code, potentially indicated by `android::RefBase::decStrong`. To further investigate and solve this issue, consider the following steps: 1. Since it's a native crash, if you have native code in your application, review related parts, especially any recent changes that could have introduced the bug. 2. Check if the error is reproducible on different devices or if it's specific to certain devices or emulators. If it's specific, it might be a hardware or OS version related issue. 3. Look up any related Unity engine issues, as the Unity version you're using might have known issues or bugs that have been fixed in later releases. 4. If your application is handling OpenGL ES or EGL resources directly, verify that all resources are correctly managed and released. 5. Review the specific functions mentioned in the stack trace for any known issues or patterns that could lead to an abort situation. 6. If the issue persists, consider reaching out to Unity support with the provided crash logs or discussing it within the Unity developer community for additional insights. 7. Update libraries and the Unity engine to the latest stable versions, which may contain bug fixes. 8. Utilize debugging tools to capture more detailed logs around the crash point. Keep in mind that debugging native crashes can be challenging, and it often requires a solid understanding of the system's inner workings and the application's native code.",

Consumer Needs Addressed: COLORS: Providing a wide range of vibrant and appealing colors. CLEAN (No mess, Long-lasting): Ensuring clean and long-lasting application. CARE (Light + Comfortable): Offering a comfortable and lightweight makeup experience. Iconic Character - Teddy Soft: Teddy Soft, a playful pink teddy bear, serves as the campaign's iconic character. Teddy Soft embodies qualities like cuteness, youthfulness, fluffiness, comfort, playfulness, and huggability. He is used to create an emotional connection with the product and the campaign's values. Campaign Approach: The campaign strategically leverages Teddy Soft's attributes to connect with the audience emotionally. Teddy Soft enhances the appeal of the product and serves as a memorable and meaningful brand symbol. Activation Strategy: The campaign includes multiple phases, starting with a teaser phase, online engagement, virtual events, and culminating in a highly anticipated on-ground activation. These phases aim to generate excitement, foster a connection with the audience, and promote the product effectively. Overall Message: The campaign seeks to introduce Maybelline Superstay Teddy Tint in a way that resonates with consumers seeking makeup products that meet their demands for vibrant colors, clean and long-lasting application, and comfortable wear.

    "reference_response": "It seems you have laid out a comprehensive summary of the Teddy Tint campaign with a clear focus on the objectives, consumer needs, and the utilization of Teddy Soft as the campaign's mascot. The approach seems to draw on emotional engagement, combining the product's physical attributes—such as a variety of colors, long-lasting wear, and lightweight comfort—with the symbolic representation of those attributes through Teddy Soft. The campaign appears well structured, unfolding across different phases to build excitement and maintain consumer interest. By emphasizing the softness and comfort associated with the teddy bear, the campaign implicitly suggests that the makeup product will offer a similarly gentle and pleasing experience. The narrative encapsulates a marketing strategy that not only showcases the product's features but also crafts a story and character that consumers can connect with, potentially boosting brand affinity and loyalty. With this strategy, Maybelline would attract attention in the competitive beauty market, appealing to customers who prioritize both aesthetic results and the sensory experience of using makeup. If executed well, the Teddy Tint campaign could effectively position the Superstay Teddy Tint as a delightful and reliable choice for consumers seeking a natural and effortless enhancement to their beauty routine.",

However in Kenya, a critical research gap in evidence-based policy discussions demands immediate attention to advance these efforts towards building resilience for the most vulnerable segments of society. Presently, there is a lack of a dedicated community-led framework and relevant indicators that can effectively align coastal restoration and rehabilitation initiatives with the priorities of different social groups, especially those who are vulnerable and marginalized, such as women, children, indigenous communities, persons with disabilities, and minorities, all residing within the coastal regions. Additionally, there is a pressing need to establish methods for measuring and reporting the effectiveness of these restoration and rehabilitation efforts in addressing the intersectional vulnerabilities within these communities. Furthermore, linking the lessons learned from these initiatives to national adaptation plans and NDCs (Nationally Determined Contributions) is essential for ensuring a comprehensive approach to coastal resilience and safeguarding the interests of the vulnerable populations. The project aims to co-create locally led restoration indicators with the established community of practices and all the stakeholders through development of evidence based policy labs. Our project main goals: 1. To map out all stakeholders and establish a community of practice in coastal conservation and restoration. 2. To assess Policy, Institutional Framework and Knowledge gaps on coastal ecosystem restoration initiatives. 3.

Breaking News: Großgermanisches Reich under Hermann Göring unveils war justification on United States of America and England Washington D.C. - In a shocking press conference held earlier this morning, Hermann Göring, the leader of the Großgermanisches Reich, unveiled his plan to declare war on the United States of America and England. The war justification, which has been in the works for several months, cites a number of grievances against the two nations, including alleged political and economic interference in the Reich's affairs. Speaking to a packed crowd of journalists and supporters in Berlin, Göring expressed his frustration with what he called \"the meddling of foreign powers in our domestic affairs.\" He went on to criticize the United States and England for their policies toward the Reich, calling them \"hypocritical and destructive.\" \"We have tried to negotiate with these nations in good faith, but they have rejected our proposals and continued to interfere in our affairs,\" Göring stated. \"We cannot stand idly by and let them continue to undermine our sovereignty.\" The announcement has sent shockwaves throughout the world, with leaders from across the globe condemning the Reich's actions. President Roosevelt of the United States has already issued a statement denouncing the justification as \"baseless and unprovoked.\" \"The United States and our allies will not stand for this kind of aggression,\" Roosevelt declared. \"We will defend ourselves and our partners against any and all threats to our security.\" The situation is rapidly evolving, with rumors of military mobilizations in both the Reich and the United States.

The prize aims to support and encourage poets at the mid-career stage, with a prize of £5000 for the winning second collection. Speaking of Ní Churreáin’s nominated work, judges Togara Muzanenhamo and Penelope Shuttle said: “Drawing inspiration from the concept of restorative justice – Annemarie Ní Churreáin’s The Poison Glen entwines legend from the Gaeltacht landscape with moments from history to depict the systematic mistreatment of unmarried or abandoned mothers and the children born to these women. Ní Churreáin revisits locations of state care institutions in Ireland over the past hundred years and beyond with an inquisitive lens that requires us to ask what the left-behind sites remember or what sense of the child remains after trauma. The Poison Glen stands as a literary monument to silenced voices”. ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW Originally from Cloich Cheann Fhaola, Ní Churreáin's books include Bloodroot, Doire Press, 2017, Town, The Salvage Press, 2018, and The Poison Glen, The Gallery Press, 2021. She is a recipient of the Irish Arts Council’s Next Generation Artist Award and a co-recipient of The Markievicz Award. She is Poetry Editor at The Stinging Fly Magazine. Her most recent literary project, a limited edition poetry pamphlet titled Ghostgirl, explores the Stranorlar Workhouse and Stranorlar County Home, also known as Stranorlar Mother and Baby Home. The project was a commission of the Donegal Archives Service as part of the Donegal Decade of Centenaries Programme. Co-judge Togara Muzanenhamo said: “The award is particularly special because it celebrates the accomplishment of what can be an artistic hurdle for some poets – compiling a second collection. There are numerous prizes for first collections and best collections but few focus on the pivotal role of a poets’ second book – a book that may highlight a poet’s maturing voice or solidify their career. I am excited at the prospect of reading work that will confidently explore and freely navigate language and introduce us to voices that will shape the future of poetry”.

Claude 3.0은 Opus, Sonnet, Haiku라는 3가지 모델로 이루어져있으며 각 모델은 성능뿐만 아니라 자체적인 윤리성도 검증했다고 합니다! 2024-03-12 | 이영빈 최근 거대언어모델(LLM)에 지각변동이 있는 모델이 공개되었습니다. 바로 Anthropic에서 만든 Claude 3.0 모델이 그 주인공입니다. Claude 3.0의 경우 처음 공개되었을때 GPT-4와 다르게 사회적 임팩트가 낮았다고 생각합니다. 그러나 점차 인공지능에 관심있는 사람들이 한두명씩 사용하기 시작하더니 많은 사람들이 GPT-4보다 더 나은 모델이 나왔다는 극찬을 했습니다. 필자 또한 Claude 3.0을 사용한 이후 GPT-4나 Gemini보다 훨씬 더 많이 사용하게 되고 있습니다. 이번 블로그에서는 Claude 3.0을 만든 Antropic이라는 회사를 알아보고 Claude 3.0에 대해서도 탐구해보겠습니다. Anthropic, OpenAI에서 뛰쳐나온 사람들이 만든회사 anthropic logo Anthropic은 회사의 근원부터 OpenAI와 연관되어 있습니다. 이전 블로그에서 작성했듯 OpenAI는 비영리기관으로 시작했다가 자금 문제가 발생해 OpenAI Global LLC라는 영리 자회사를 만들어서 운영하기 시작했습니다. 추가로 OpenAI는 2020년 GPT-3를 공개할 때 다른 기업들이 오픈소스를 외칠 때 API만 제공하는 방식으로 영리화하기 시작했습니다. 추가적으로 Microsoft와 OpenAI 영리 자회사가 협력관계를 갖기 시작했습니다. 이런 큰 변화에 있어서 기존에 있던 OpenAI 엔지니어들은 알트만의 행보에 반대하는 사람들이 있었으며 이들이 퇴사해서 만든 회사가 Anthropic입니다. 그렇기에 Anthropic은 OpenAI와 차별성을 두기 위해 공익회사임을 표방하고 있으며 미션 또한 ‘인류에게 도움이 되는 대규모 AI 시스템을 구축하는 것’입니다. 이때 AI 시스템은 반드시 안정성, 투명성, 윤리성에 가치를 두고 있어야 한다고 합니다. 이런 철학을 바탕으로 Anthropic은 자사만의 독특한 AI 학습 방식인 ‘헌신적 구성(Constitutional AI)’을 개발했습니다. 이는 AI 모델이 스스로 윤리 원칙을 체화하도록 학습시키는 것으로, 기존의 단순한 방식과는 차별화됩니다. 이를 통해 Anthropic은 강력하면서도 안전하고 신뢰할 수 있는 AI 시스템을 만들고자 합니다. Anthropic이 발표한 Claude는 2023년에 발표한 대화형 AI 모델을 선보였고 빠르게 버전업을 진행하고 있습니다. 이번에 발표한 Claude 3.0은 기존 Claude 모델들의 장점은 계승하면서 성능은 한층 더 높였습니다. Claude 3.0의 특징 Claude 3.0의 가장 큰 특징은 모델 크기의 다양화입니다. 기존의 Claude 1.0과 2.1은 하나의 모델로 제공되었던 반면, Claude 3.0은 Claude Haiku, Claude-Sonnet, Claude-Opus의 세 가지 버전으로 출시되었습니다. 각 모델은 규모와 성능에서 차이가 있어 사용자의 요구사항에 맞는 모델을 선택할 수 있게 되었습니다. 각 모델을 비교하기 앞서 우선 성능부터 확인해보겠습니다. Claude 3.0 benchmark Anthropic에서 제시한 Claude 3.0 성적표를 보면 놀랍습니다. Claude 3 Opus의 경우 GPT-4나 Gemini 1.0 Ultra와 비교해도 훨씬 더 좋은 벤치마크 성적표를 갖고 있다고 볼 수 있습니다. 가장 눈에 띄는 지표는 Multilingual Math 파트인데 Opus의 0-shot이 기존 GPT-4가 8-shot을 주었을때 나온 결과보다 더 좋았습니다. Claude 3 Sonnet은 GPT-4에 비해 밀리는 분야가 분명 있긴 하지만 Claude chat에서는 무료로 사용하기 때문에 같은 무료제품인 GPT-3.5나 Gemini Pro와 비교하면 훨씬 좋은 성능을 갖고 있음을 알 수 있습니다. Haiku의 경우 가장 작은 모델임에도 Gemini Pro정도 수준의 성능을 갖고 있어 전체적으로 Claude 3.0의 성능이 매우 좋다는걸 알 수 있습니다. Claude 3.0 모델들 Claude 3.0 model family 각각의 모델에 대해 알아보면 가장 좋은 모델인 Claude Opus의 경우 가장 성능이 좋고 완벽한 언어모델이라 할 수 있습니다. 그렇기에 Claude Opus는 Chat으로 사용할 경우 Claude Pro를 결제해야 사용할 수 있습니다. 토큰 당 가격도 꽤 비싼 편인데 입력 토큰은 100만 토큰당 15달러이며 출력 토큰은 100만 토큰당 75달러 수준입니다. 현재 OpenAI에서 제공하는 GPT-4 Turbo가 입력토큰이 100만 토큰당 10달러, 출력 토큰인 100만 토큰당 30달러 수준인걸 감안하면 상당히 비싸다는걸 알 수 있습니다. 중간 모델인 Claude Sonnet는 GPT-4 정도의 능력을 갖고 있지 않지만 준수한 출력 속도와 합리적인 가격인 모델입니다. Claude Sonnet은 Chat으로 사용할 경우 무료로 사용할 수 있으며 토큰 당 가격은 입력 토큰은 100만 토큰당 3달러이며 출력 토큰은 100만 토큰당 15달러입니다. 해당 가격은 GPT-4 Turbo보다 훨씬 싼 가격이지만 GPT-3.5-turbo랑 비교하면 조금 더 비싸게 받고 있습니다. 마지막으로 Claude Haiku는 가장 가벼운 모델이기 때문에 성능보다 추론 속도에 더 집중한 모델입니다. 가격의 경우에도 입력은 100만 토큰당 0.25달러, 출력은 100만 토큰당 1.25달러입니다. 가격 그리고 속도가 가장 빠르지만 벤치마크 성능에서는 밀리는 모델이라 볼 수 있습니다. Claude 3.0의 그밖의 특징들 한편 Claude 3.0의 또 다른 특징은 안전성과 윤리성을 강화했다는 점입니다. Anthropic은 자사 AI 모델의 안전성을 높이기 위해 ‘헌신적 구성(Constitutional AI)’이라는 독자적인 학습 방식을 사용하고 있습니다. 이는 AI에게 명확한 윤리 원칙과 행동 규범을 내재화시켜, 악용 가능성을 원천 차단하는 것이 목표입니다. Claude 3.0에는 이런 노력이 더욱 심도있게 반영되었다고 합니다. 추가적으로 이번 Claude 3.0에는 다국어 지원 기능도 대폭 확대되었습니다. 영어를 비롯해 한국어, 일본어, 중국어, 스페인어, 프랑스어, 독일어 등 주요 언어의 이해와 생성 능력이 크게 향상되었습니다. 이는 Claude의 글로벌 서비스 확장에도 기여할 것으로 보입니다. Claude 3.0의 영향력 Claude 3.0의 등장으로 AI 기술 발전이 새로운 국면을 맞이했습니다. 자연어처리 능력의 고도화, 다양한 규모의 모델 제공, 강화된 윤리성과 다국어 처리 역량까지 Anthropic은 이 모든 혁신을 Claude 3.0에 담아냈습니다. 앞으로 Claude를 활용한 다양한 서비스와 애플리케이션이 등장할 것으로 기대됩니다. 기업의 고객 상담 자동화부터 개인 비서, 교육 보조 도구까지, Claude의 활약상을 상상하니 벌써부터 설레는데요. 물론 강력한 AI 모델인만큼 오남용의 위험성도 있습니다. 하지만 Anthropic이 추구하는 ‘헌신적 구성’ 원칙에 따라 Claude는 스스로를 규제하고 인간에게 이로운 방향으로 나아갈 것입니다. 우리가 AI의 힘을 어떻게 현명하게 사용할 것인지가 중요한 과제로 남아있네요. 한편 많은 사람들이 OpenAI의 ChatGPT에서 Claude로 눈길을 돌리고 있습니다. 현재 SNS에서 많은 사람들이 GPT Pro를 해지하고 Claude Pro로 넘어간걸 확인할 수 있습니다. 스포트라이트를 뺏기는 걸 걱정하는 OpenAI 측에서 Gemini 1.5를 Sora로 덮었듯이 Claude 3를 어떤 새로운 기술로 다시 왕좌를 차지할 지 기대가 됩니다. (몇몇 사람들의 전망으로 3/14일이 GPT-4 1주년이 되는 해라서 무엇인가 준비하고 있지 않을까라는 루머가 있긴 합니다.) 앞으로의 전망 지금까지 Anthropic의 Claude 3.0에 대해 살펴보았습니다. 인공지능 기술이 나날이 발전하면서 우리 삶에 가져올 변화가 기대되는 한편, 부작용은 없을지 살짝 걱정도 됩니다. 앞으로도 AI가 가져올 혁신의 물결에 귀 기울이면서, 동시에 건전하고 지속가능한 발전 방향을 모색해 나가야 할 것 같습니다. 레퍼런스 Claude 3.0 소개글 이영빈 모두의연구소 🖥️ 모두의연구소 아이펠 퍼실리테이터 🏛️ JAX-KR 오거나이저 😎 GDG SongDo 오거나이저 목록으로 돌아가기 공유하기 (주)모두의연구소 | 대표 김승일 | 사업자등록번호 517-88-00184 | 개인정보보호정책 | FAQ | 1:1 문의 | 채용 | 오시는 길 서울 강남구 강남대로 324 (역삼디오슈페리움) 2층: 모두의연구소 강남캠퍼스 서울 강남구 역삼로 156 태광빌딩 2층: 모두의연구소 역삼캠퍼스 대전 중구 중앙로 119 대전테크노파크 디스테이션 12층 : 모두의연구소 대전캠퍼스 대표전화 070-7743-5882",

    "reference_response": "Dear Ms. Amanda, I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to bring to your attention an important matter regarding our recent discussions on overcoming CE certificate and other required standards for our devices. Due to the high danger class associated with this particular device, our Ministry of Health (MOH) has become stricter in terms of importing such products from G4 countries such as China, India, and Southeast Asian nations. Obtaining the necessary standards and certificates can be a time-consuming process, which poses challenges for us. In order to address this issue, I would like to suggest two possible alternatives. Firstly, we could offer Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) options to comply with the standards and certificates required. Alternatively, we could pursue the Completely Knocked Down (CKD) or Semi Knocked Down (SKD) options. I would like to emphasize that our company has an annual requirement of over 200 devices, and we have successfully completed CKD orders with major brands such as VIMS (France) and Hermann (Germany). Our country has also invested in special facilities and options tailored for CKD or SKD production, which supports domestic production and job creation. This setup enables us to overcome the obstacles related to standards and licenses more efficiently. Additionally, I would like to highlight that if the trial version and field test of the Insufflator meet our requirements and specifications, we are eager to place a significantly larger order. I appreciate your attention to this matter and would be grateful for any input or guidance you can provide. Thank you for your continued support. Best regards, [Your Name]",

Proponents believe it will help curb illegal immigration and bolster national security, while opponents argue it's a waste of resources, environmentally detrimental, and a symbol of exclusion inconsistent with America's values. - **Mexico:** The Mexican government condemns the announcement as an antagonistic act that does nothing to foster cooperation or solve the complex issues related to migration and cross-border ties. Civil society groups and activists in Mexico protest the decision. - **Central American countries:** Countries like Honduras, Guatemala, and El Salvador express concern that the wall will adversely impact their citizens seeking refuge or economic opportunities in the United States. - **Canada:** Canada expresses concern over the symbolism of the wall and its potential impact on the broader perception of immigration policies in North America. **2017-2018 - Construction and Ongoing International Reactions** - **U.S. domestic reaction:** As construction begins on parts of the border, political and legal battles ensue over land rights, environmental impact assessments, and the allocation of funds for the wall's construction. - **Mexico:** Collaborative border initiatives between the U.S. and Mexico face strain. Cultural exchange programs, trade discussions, and other bi-national cooperation efforts suffer as the Mexican government continues to decry the wall. - **Other Latin American countries:** Some countries, particularly in Latin America, criticize the project for setting a negative precedent for international relations in the Western Hemisphere. - **European Union:** European leaders express concern over the wall's message and effects on international collaboration, citing the need for comprehensive immigration reform rather than isolationist policies. **2018-2019 - Further Escalation and Consequences** - **U.S. domestic reaction:** Environmental groups and border state stakeholders intensify protests as the magnitude of the wall's ecological impact becomes clearer. - **Mexico:** Mexico explores ways to strengthen its economic independence from the U.S. and deepens trade relationships with other nations in response to the wall. - **United Nations:** The U.N. may issue statements about the necessity of respecting international law and human rights, emphasizing holistic approaches to managing migration. - **Global Perceptions:** Around the globe, the wall becomes a potent symbol in discussions about sovereignty, human mobility, and global responsibility for migration and refugees. **April 2019 - Status Update** - By the two-year mark, only portions of the wall may have been completed due to logistical challenges. The effort's symbolism continues to shape global perceptions of U.S. foreign policy. Some countries use the wall as evidence of a need for a multipolar world order less dependent on U.S. leadership. **Economic Impact** The construction of such a massive and lengthy wall would require significant financial resources, likely in the tens of billions of dollars. This would affect the U.S. federal budget and could lead to reallocations of spending from other areas, potentially causing domestic and international criticism regarding fiscal priorities amidst other global and humanitarian needs. **Long-Term Effects** In the long term, such a wall, aside from the aforementioned reactions and potential diplomatic fallout, would also have significant effects on wildlife, ecosystems, local communities, and border economies. It would also create a visual and physical embodiment of a closed-border policy that would be referenced in immigration debates for years to come. **Disclaimers** - The description provided here is a fictional interpretation and does not reflect any actual plans or international reactions, as of my knowledge cutoff in March 2023, there is no such project akin to the Great Wall of China at the U.S.-Mexico border. - The responses of countries and organizations are speculative and intended to capture what typical reactions might entail based on historical diplomatic patterns and the known stances of the involved parties on border security and international cooperation. Real-world scenarios may differ widely based on a multitude of factors, including geopolitical context, administration priorities, and unforeseen events.",
